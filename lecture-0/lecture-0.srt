>> All right.

3
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:11,536
Apologies for the delay.

00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,546
Welcome to Computer Science
S-75, Building Dynamic Websites.

5
00:00:15,636 --> 00:00:16,496
My name is David.

6
00:00:16,496 --> 00:00:17,946
I'll be your instructor
this summer.

7
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:20,156
And it's a pretty brief summer.

8
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:22,646
So we're going to dive right
in tonight to some material,

9
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:26,826
then we'll take a breathe, look
at the structure of the course,

10
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,616
expectations thereof,
and then conclude

11
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:29,906
with some additional material.

12
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:31,446
And along the way,
please interject

13
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:32,796
with any questions
that you might have.

14
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:33,896
But first some questions
from me.

15
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:38,306
So, you go ahead on the internet
on your laptop or desktop.

16
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:39,656
You pull up your
favorite browser,

17
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:44,206
you type in www.google.com
and hit enter, what happens?

18
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:47,656
Let's tell the story and we can
be as high level or low level

19
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,666
as we want and I'll steer
us in both directions.

20
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,386
So you've hit enter,
what happens?

21
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:53,456
Give me anything you got.

22
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:53,676
Yeah?

23
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:55,246
>> Well, first the request
is sent through your modem

24
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:58,526
to your internet
service provider

25
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:00,916
to wherever the Google
website is stored

26
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,446
and then the information
is sent back.

27
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:03,746
>> Oh good, OK.

28
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:04,516
So that's the whole story.

29
00:01:04,576 --> 00:01:05,236
So that's very good.

30
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:07,046
Let's tease it apart
a little bit now.

31
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:08,606
And I'll repeat some of
the answers sometimes

32
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,566
into the microphone so that our
folks who are taking the course

33
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,776
from afar can hear everything.

34
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:16,976
So your computer makes a request
to your-- through your modem,

35
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,606
goes to your ISP,
reaches google.com servers

36
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:21,296
and they reply with a response.

37
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:24,166
So good, now let's dive in
deeper there, and let's focus

38
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,166
on the active hitting enter to
someone want to propose what--

39
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,526
give me just one step, in
more technical detail what

40
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:31,296
happens next.

41
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,576
And then we'll get to that
same end point eventually.

42
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:37,856
[ Inaudible Remark ]

43
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:41,016
Perfect. So we first need to
translate the name of the site,

44
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:44,216
in this case www.google.com,
into an IP address.

45
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:47,706
And someone else,
what is an IP address?

46
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:47,976
Yeah.

47
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:52,556
>> Well, it identifies
like a server or?

48
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:53,736
>> OK, good.

49
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:56,506
So an IP address, it
identifies a server

50
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:57,706
or computer on the internet.

51
00:01:57,706 --> 00:02:01,416
And an IP address is simply
a number of this form.

52
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,246
Let me go ahead and pull

53
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:04,776
up a little scratch
pad for notes here.

54
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:10,236
So, an IP address, as you've
probably seen, is something

55
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:14,526
of the form w.x.y.z. And
little internet trivia,

56
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,196
each of these placeholders can
be a digit from what to what?

57
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:19,946
Or number from what to what?

58
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:21,366
Sure.

59
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:22,236
>> Zero to 255.

60
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:23,366
>> Perfect.

61
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:24,446
Zero to 255.

62
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:26,616
And there's some restrictions
on what numbers can be where

63
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:29,026
but essentially you have number
dot number dot number dot

64
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:31,156
number, and each of those
numbers can be again zero

65
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:32,376
through 255.

66
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,956
And if we really want to start
pressing deeper here how many

67
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,676
bits is used to represent
an entire IP address

68
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:39,646
under the schema?

69
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:44,956
For those familiar
with bits, 32.

70
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:45,836
So why is that?

71
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:48,736
Well for those less
familiar, unfamiliar,

72
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:51,746
if you want to represent
the number zero through 255,

73
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,936
which is a total of 256
numbers, you need 8 bits,

74
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,216
because 2 to the 8th is 256.

75
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:59,896
But we won't go into too much
detail on along those lines.

76
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:03,046
But if you've seen that IP
addresses are just 32 bits,

77
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:06,806
it is because each of these
numbers is 8 bits itself.

78
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:09,606
So actually, let's go here,
there won't be much math

79
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,466
in this course after the
following sentence really.

80
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:13,826
But if you have 32 bits,

81
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:16,286
how many possible IP
addresses are there

82
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:17,636
for the world's computers?

83
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:21,346
Yeah.

84
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:23,196
[ Inaudible Remark ]

85
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:25,346
So it's 2 to the 32nd
which is roughly?

86
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:26,776
Those who are good with
math in their heads?

87
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:29,786
So it's roughly 4 billion.

88
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,666
So that's a lot but these
days most of you have laptops,

89
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:38,556
most of you have desktops,
most of you have telephones

90
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:40,766
in your pockets or
iPads or the like.

91
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,326
So there's more and
more devices these days

92
00:03:42,326 --> 00:03:43,646
that are consuming IP addresses.

93
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:46,996
So if you follow the popular
media of late you'll find

94
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:48,686
that people have been
freaking out that we're

95
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,226
about to run out
of IP addresses.

96
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:51,956
But that's because we've
been using version 4

97
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:52,726
for far too long.

98
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:55,376
Thankfully, version 6 has
begun to get rolled out

99
00:03:55,706 --> 00:04:00,286
and version 6 will have 128 bit
IP addresses, which is great

100
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:02,776
because that's 2 to
the 128, which is huge,

101
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:03,976
barely pronounceable,

102
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,756
but it will also become
a little more complex

103
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,056
to write these things down.

104
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:10,456
So we can squeeze a few
more years of discussion

105
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:11,306
out of these addresses

106
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:13,366
but realize the world
is transitioning.

107
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,746
Now just for the sake of the
experience for those at home.

108
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:18,316
Let me actually pause
here, just so we can plug

109
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:20,866
in this recording device so we
can capture to another format.

110
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:23,336
So let's leave that as a
cliffhanger for just a minute

111
00:04:23,606 --> 00:04:25,926
or two and I'll be right back.

112
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:27,976
So, where do we leave off?

113
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,906
You'd just hit enter,
we had proposed

114
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:32,266
that your computer had
translated or needed

115
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:36,156
to translate the host
name www.google.com

116
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:37,726
into an IP address and
then we talked for a moment

117
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:39,996
about various forms
of IP addresses.

118
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,616
So let's now push
a little harder

119
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,456
on how this translation happens.

120
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:46,046
So Google has a numeric
address of this form.

121
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:48,936
And as an aside Google actually
has probably a whole bunch

122
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:50,136
of IP address of that form.

123
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:52,306
All of which lead to
the same experience

124
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:53,986
but perhaps different servers.

125
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:56,716
So how does your
little Mac or PC

126
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:59,556
or Linux computer know
what the IP address

127
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:02,146
of www.google.com actually is?

128
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:06,696
>> It has to do with a domain
name lookup, the DNS servers.

129
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:07,186
>> OK. Good.

130
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:09,876
So it has to do with domain
name lookup using a DNS server.

131
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,766
So for those unfamiliar
DNS is Domain Name System.

132
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:14,606
And this is an infrastructure
on the internet

133
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,196
that pretty much
does exactly that.

134
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:18,526
It converts domain
names and host names

135
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:21,186
to IP addresses and vice versa.

136
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,846
And we'll see tonight that it
does a few other things in terms

137
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:27,376
of helping with rerouting
of email, with validation

138
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:29,506
of ownership of domains
and the like.

139
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,026
So there are these
servers out there.

140
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:33,716
Now your computer, your home
probably doesn't have its own

141
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:36,996
DNS server but probably
Harvard does if you're on campus

142
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:40,166
or Comcast does or Verizon
or your company does.

143
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:42,936
Now if you're at a small
college, for instance,

144
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:44,426
and you're not visiting
google.com

145
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:47,056
but you're visiting
somerandomwebsite.com,

146
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:49,466
it's very possible that you are
the first person on that campus

147
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:52,546
to visit that website ever
or at least in a long time.

148
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:57,616
So what if you're small little
campus's DNS server has no idea

149
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,006
what this IP address is?

150
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:02,066
Are you sort of out of luck
because you went to that school

151
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:04,456
and not one where there's more
people using that websites?

152
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:07,086
Or equivalently it's kind of
a chicken and the egg problem.

153
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:09,576
If you're the first person to
ever need to visit that website

154
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:12,056
and therefore your campus's
DNS server has no idea what

155
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:16,556
that mapping is, how do
you solve this problem?

156
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:16,746
Yeah.

157
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:21,836
[ Inaudible Remark ]

158
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:24,866
Exactly, so there's a
hierarchy, thankfully,

159
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:28,166
to the DNS system whereby even
though you might have your own

160
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,096
DNS server on campus or company

161
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:33,196
but that doesn't necessarily
store all possible domain names

162
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:34,536
and IP addresses in the world.

163
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:37,086
In fact, that would be quite
a large database otherwise,

164
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:38,696
and it's just not
efficient to keep all of them

165
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:39,996
around if they're
not being accessed

166
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:41,756
at all or very frequently.

167
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:45,206
But your ISP knows some
bigger fish and maybe

168
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,146
that bigger fish knows
an even bigger fish

169
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:49,626
that has its own DNS
servers that might know.

170
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:52,856
But in the worst, if no one
along this hierarchy knows,

171
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:55,216
there also exists in the world
what are called root servers

172
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:57,296
which are spread
out geographically

173
00:06:57,296 --> 00:07:00,076
across the several continents,
and it's those root servers

174
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:03,936
that essentially know who does
know what the IP address is

175
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,986
of somerandomwebsite.com.

176
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:08,596
In other words, those
root servers know

177
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:11,506
who the authority is for
instance for all of the dot coms

178
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:14,386
in the world or all of the
dot nets or the like so

179
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:16,516
that you can have
this initial request

180
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,706
from little old your
computer bubble

181
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:22,106
up to these very high level
servers and then bubble back

182
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:25,126
down to some authority
who does actually know.

183
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:26,946
And the reason for that--

184
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:29,416
that that works is
because when you go

185
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,706
and buy your own domain name,
which is a process we'll discuss

186
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:36,906
in just a bit, you have to tell
the world what the IP address is

187
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,786
of your DNS server.

188
00:07:38,786 --> 00:07:41,916
So someone has to be informed
proactively once really

189
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:43,556
and only once when
you buy the domain.

190
00:07:43,786 --> 00:07:46,206
So for now, let's come back
to our story, we've hit enter,

191
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:48,426
google.com was in
my browser's window,

192
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,406
my computer has somehow
figured out that it is 1.2.3.4

193
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:53,296
or something like that.

194
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:56,366
So now my computer puts
together a message to send it

195
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:58,526
across the internet
to google.com.

196
00:07:58,526 --> 00:07:59,686
What does that message
look like?

197
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,816
Well, in it's simplest
form it's a message

198
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,316
that pretty much
looks like this.

199
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:06,606
It is literally the word
GET in all caps, a space,

200
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:09,156
a forward slash, if you're
just requesting the root

201
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:11,486
of the web server demarked
typically with slash.

202
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:14,596
And then HTTP slash
version number.

203
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:17,846
Now in reality there's a few
more headers, so to speak.

204
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:20,856
HTTP headers that gets
sent from browser to server

205
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:22,666
and we'll see those in
action in just a bit.

206
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:26,796
But this message captures
really the most import aspect

207
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:27,416
of the request.

208
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:30,836
So your little computer
creates a virtual envelope,

209
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,706
more technically called
a packet of some sort.

210
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:34,946
Inside of that packet
is a message like this.

211
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:37,756
I'll put on the front of
that virtual envelope is a

212
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:41,886
to address namely 1.2.3.4 or
whatever Google's IP address is.

213
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:44,546
In the return field of this
virtual envelope, you know,

214
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:46,216
just like you were mailing
something to a human,

215
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,186
there is the return
address who--

216
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:50,186
which should be whose
IP address, probably?

217
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:54,406
So your own IP address and
your computer does know

218
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:55,936
that if you have an
internet connection.

219
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,736
And then your computer sends
it out on the internet.

220
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:00,936
Now we can dive deeper
and deeper and deeper

221
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:05,086
but for now assume that your
ISP has what's called a default

222
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,006
gateway, a.k.a router.

223
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,496
And routers are the computers
on the internet that know how

224
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:11,376
to get data from
point A to point B

225
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:14,326
or if they don't know
precisely how to go from A to B,

226
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,976
they know whom to
pass it off to,

227
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:19,806
who can then get it one
step closer to point B.

228
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:23,596
So in reality a packet, this
virtual envelope might go

229
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,886
from router to router to router
to router, sometimes as many

230
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,666
as many 30 different
routers across the globe

231
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:32,196
until finally it gets to its
actual destination, google.com.

232
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,756
Google receives this virtual
envelope, sees that it's

233
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:38,406
for its IP address, opens the
envelope up, sees this message.

234
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:41,736
google.com server happens to
be running a web server and so

235
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:44,136
that web server looks for
the file called slash.

236
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:47,596
Now slash is typically a
synonym for an actual filename

237
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:51,106
like index.html or
index.php or any number

238
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,506
of other default
standard filenames.

239
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:56,936
So Google grabs that file from
its hard drive and then puts it

240
00:09:56,936 --> 00:10:00,536
in its own virtual envelope,
flips the two IP addresses,

241
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:02,276
the from and the
sender, sends it back

242
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:03,706
to the internet via
these routers.

243
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,206
It arrives on my computer.

244
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,716
I have my computer, unbeknownst
to me, opens this envelope,

245
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,946
sees a whole bunch of
language called HTML,

246
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:15,166
renders that HTML top to bottom
and I see the search page

247
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:16,966
for Google's main site.

248
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:17,046
Yeah?

249
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:22,356
>> What is the function
of the slash?

250
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:23,766
>> What is the function
of the slash?

251
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:27,516
So whenever you type
in a URL, you--

252
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:29,506
there are several
different components to it.

253
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:34,676
Http typically followed by ://
followed by something like this,

254
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,136
and so this is let's say
a representative URL.

255
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,556
But we can actually tease this
apart into a few components.

256
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,776
This is the protocol or
schema at the beginning.

257
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:47,366
Even though in a browser we
almost always use http://.

258
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:48,596
Have folks seen others?

259
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:49,746
Yeah?

260
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:50,666
>> HTTPS.

261
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:56,266
>> HTTPS similar but different
in that it uses cryptography,

262
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:59,006
a topic we'll come back to.

263
00:10:59,056 --> 00:10:59,256
Yeah?

264
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:00,606
>> Ftp://.

265
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:03,586
>> Ftp://, sftp://, webcal://,

266
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:05,716
some of these are more
standardized than others

267
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,476
but the schema is typically
an indicator to some piece

268
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:12,476
of software how it should view
the contents at that address.

269
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,576
So what comes after the ://?

270
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:17,166
You typically have
something called a host name

271
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:20,106
or subdomain name
followed by the domain name

272
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,586
which in this case
is google.com,

273
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,326
or followed more precisely
by a domain name with a TLD,

274
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:31,906
top-level domain, a .com, .edu,
.gov, .uk would be the TLD.

275
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:34,346
And then you have
what we call a path.

276
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:37,016
And a path specifies
exactly what file

277
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:38,476
or folder you want to access.

278
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:42,686
So a single slash means get
me the root of my hard drive

279
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:44,746
and if you come from
the Windows world,

280
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,086
this is essentially
equivalent to c:

281
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:49,256
or on a Mac it's
equivalent to that

282
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:51,106
or on Linux computer
it's equivalent to that.

283
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:53,666
So that is truly the
root of your hard drive,

284
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:57,376
the folder in which everything
else on your hard drive lives.

285
00:11:58,256 --> 00:12:00,806
Now, it turns out you--
in a browser these days,

286
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:02,796
you don't have to
type most of that.

287
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:05,276
You can omit the HTTP, you
can typically omit the www,

288
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:08,616
you can omit the slash
and things just work.

289
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:09,626
Why is that?

290
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:10,536
Well, for the most part,

291
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:12,956
it's because browsers have just
gotten a lot more user friendly,

292
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:13,436
right.

293
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:16,796
There was a time, a few years
ago where advertisements

294
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:20,436
in prints and on TV would
actually have http://

295
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:22,866
but then the world kind
of realized that you know,

296
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:26,226
anytime you see www something,
it's probably a website

297
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:29,346
so we started omitting http://.

298
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:31,726
Now the world has gotten
acclimated to any mention

299
00:12:31,726 --> 00:12:36,236
of .com or .gov so we don't even
really need the www anymore.

300
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:39,056
And so, whether or not www works

301
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:42,006
or doesn't work is actually
completely configurable

302
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,966
by the system administrators
of a website.

303
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:48,946
And in fact, I don't have a sort
of a soapbox to hop on right now

304
00:12:48,946 --> 00:12:50,956
but invariably during
a semester,

305
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:54,136
I'll come across some
website for which foo.com

306
00:12:54,136 --> 00:12:57,076
or whatever their domain
is .com just doesn't work,

307
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,946
you have to type in
www.something.com

308
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,646
and that's just a foolish
technical design decision

309
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:04,176
on their part.

310
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:06,726
We'll talk today about how
you can configure things

311
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:07,576
to just work.

312
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:10,896
And it involves a bit of DNS, a
bit of web server configuration

313
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:14,096
but typically, you
don't see that dead end

314
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:17,246
because browsers these
days, if you type in foo.com

315
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:20,586
and hit enter and there is no
foo.com IP address out there,

316
00:13:20,796 --> 00:13:24,986
the browser will presumptuously
or helpfully prepen www

317
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:28,906
to the start of the address
and then retry that one.

318
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,716
Some browsers, if
you just type foo,

319
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:33,006
will automatically
try .com, .net,

320
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:34,586
.gov some of the
most popular ones.

321
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:36,926
So in short, a lot of
the technical processes

322
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:39,516
that are happening are
being sort of hidden now

323
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:42,816
by browser user friendliness
for better or for worse.

324
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:46,836
So, the story began with
hitting enter, the story ended

325
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:48,726
with your seeing the
homepage of Google.

326
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,676
Any questions on the
various steps in between,

327
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,336
whether high level or low level?

328
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:59,566
Right. So that's the story told
from the perspective of a user.

329
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,686
Why don't we tell the story from
the perspective now of someone

330
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:07,006
who owns a website or
wants to operate a website?

331
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:09,676
So suppose one of your goals
in this class or some other is

332
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,376
to actually have your
own presence on the web.

333
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:14,696
When you actually buy
your own domain name

334
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:16,716
and have your own business
or personal home page

335
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:19,856
or whatever the case may be,
how do you go about doing that?

336
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:21,906
You need more than just
a laptop and a browser,

337
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:23,956
now you need a server
on the internet

338
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:26,126
because even though every
computer on the internet,

339
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:28,796
your laptop included,
has an IP address,

340
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:31,336
it's not necessarily
publicly accessible.

341
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:34,066
Because even that statement's
a bit of an oversimplification.

342
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:37,686
You do not necessarily
have a public IP address.

343
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:40,626
In fact if you go home and you
have internet access at home,

344
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:43,136
especially wireless, you
probably have a home router

345
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:46,806
like an Apple AirPort Extreme
or you have a Linksys router

346
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,276
or some device with antennas

347
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:50,406
that gives you wireless
internet access.

348
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:53,456
But Comcast or Verizon or
whoever you're paying each month

349
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:56,476
to give you internet access into
the house via your cable modem

350
00:14:56,476 --> 00:14:59,256
or DSL modem which in
turn is probably connected

351
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:00,436
to that router.

352
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,136
If it's not one in
the same device,

353
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:03,786
which some of the
ISPs provide these all

354
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:07,576
in one devices these days, odds
are you have one IP address.

355
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:11,826
And if you have three
brothers and sisters or parents

356
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:13,456
or grandkids in the house,

357
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:17,076
all of you are sharing
that one IP address.

358
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:18,616
And yet the individual computers

359
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:20,376
in the home still
need an IP address

360
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:22,706
so what actually is the
case is that when you're

361
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:26,076
in a home network, you have a--

362
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:28,216
what's called generally
a private IP address.

363
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:29,316
Something of the form--

364
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:31,866
anyone what a popular
internal IP address is?

365
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:34,081
[ Inaudible Remark ]

366
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:34,816
Yeah. Exactly.

367
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:37,506
Anything in fact starting

368
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:42,626
with 192.168 dot something
dot something is a private

369
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:43,316
IP address.

370
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:46,456
So the folks who invented the
internet along the way decided,

371
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:46,846
"You know what?

372
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,676
We should probably
have some IP addresses

373
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:51,686
that should never be given
out so that within a company

374
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:53,566
or a home or a little
test network,

375
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:56,496
you can have IP addresses that
are guaranteed not to exist

376
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:57,406
on the public internet."

377
00:15:57,766 --> 00:16:02,106
So what home routers typically
use is 192.168.0 or .1

378
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:05,746
and then the last digit can be
again, between zero and 255.

379
00:16:05,806 --> 00:16:08,236
But some exceptions, it
really-- it can't be zero,

380
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:11,156
can't usually be 255 so
there are some constraints

381
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:14,736
but it gives you roughly 250
or so possible IP addresses.

382
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:18,846
If you don't like that,
there's 172.16 dot something

383
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:19,506
dot something.

384
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:21,576
There's a few more
constraints on this one,

385
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:24,916
but then if you really need a
lot of internal IP addresses,

386
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:28,196
you can have a what's called
a class A private network,

387
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:30,946
10 dot anything is
a private address.

388
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:34,096
And this actually gives you
millions of IP addresses

389
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:36,916
for your home or your
business or your data center.

390
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,506
But in short, any IP
addresses beginning with these

391
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,696
and a few other prefixes
are considered private

392
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:44,706
but the problem then is that
even if after this class,

393
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:48,536
you know, HTML and CSS all the
better, you know PHP and SQL

394
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:52,326
and JavaScript and you create
a website and you run it

395
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:54,676
on your laptop using software
we'll introduce you to,

396
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:57,926
a web server called Apache,
no one in the world is going

397
00:16:57,926 --> 00:16:59,746
to be able to visit your website

398
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:02,686
because your address
probably starts with one

399
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:07,046
of theses prefixes and your
home router or cable modem

400
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:10,586
or DSL modem is not going
to let outside random people

401
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:15,416
into your home network to access
this IP address because frankly,

402
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,226
there's tens of thousands
of people who probably have

403
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:18,896
that exact same private
IP address

404
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,876
so it's just not
uniquely identifiable.

405
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,836
And because your home router

406
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:25,326
and your cable modem
is sometimes a firewall

407
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,406
onto itself, this traffic is
not going to get into your home.

408
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:30,086
So in short, that
won't work but you have

409
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:32,116
at least two options,
two alternatives.

410
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:34,796
How can you get your
websites out on the internet?

411
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,766
>> Well, if you're still trying
to leave it on your own network

412
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:42,006
if you port forward to
your own private IP address

413
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:43,346
from your public IP address.

414
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:43,726
>> You can.

415
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:44,576
Port forwarding.

416
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:46,616
So let's go there,
for those unfamiliar.

417
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:49,096
When you use a protocol
like HTTP,

418
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:53,906
you're actually using other
protocols behind the scenes

419
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:58,526
and in fact you've probably at
least heard the buzzword TCP/IP,

420
00:17:58,526 --> 00:18:01,036
Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol.

421
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:02,266
It's actually two protocols.

422
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:04,786
Two different standards
or languages, so to speak,

423
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:08,456
that govern how data can be
transmitted on the internet.

424
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:10,036
And this is a bit of
an oversimplification,

425
00:18:10,036 --> 00:18:13,636
but for today's purposes assume
that IP, the internet protocol,

426
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,136
is just a set of
conventions that humans came

427
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,146
up with years ago that govern
how you associate numeric

428
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:21,646
addresses with computers.

429
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:23,966
So IP address derives
from this protocol.

430
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,326
So IP is just the standard for
assigning computers addresses.

431
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:31,076
However, just assigning someone
an address doesn't mean you can

432
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,756
get data to that address.

433
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:35,976
For that you need another
standard, another protocol

434
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:38,916
and that's typically TCP,
Transmission Control Protocol.

435
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:44,136
So TCP is the standard that web
browsers and web servers speak

436
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:46,896
in order to actually
physically move data

437
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:49,416
or electronically
move data from point A

438
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:53,726
to point B using the higher
level notion of an IP address

439
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:56,996
to actually uniquely
identify points A and point B.

440
00:18:57,246 --> 00:19:00,676
So for those who might want to
go further in computer science

441
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:01,846
and in networking in particular,

442
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:04,516
there's typically what's
called the TCP/IP stack.

443
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,676
And so there's topics

444
00:19:06,676 --> 00:19:09,176
like there's the
transport layer down here.

445
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:12,566
There's the IP or
addressing layer here,

446
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:14,026
there's the application layer.

447
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:16,096
In short, much of the
internet is the result

448
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:18,626
of smart people having design
things and then design things

449
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,106
on top of thing on top of things

450
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:23,596
and so we just typically
oversimplify and say TCP/IP.

451
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:25,206
So what's the point there?

452
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,526
TCP/IP allows not
just the web to work

453
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:30,886
but all sorts of applications.

454
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:33,836
There's the web, there's email,
there's instant messaging,

455
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:37,226
there's-- I mean what else--
there's things like Spotify,

456
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:39,756
there's dedicated applications
that are using the internet

457
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:41,946
but aren't necessarily
inside of a browser.

458
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:45,636
So a server can actually
do multiple things.

459
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:47,876
It can receive email
like Gmail can.

460
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:50,536
It can be a website
and get HTTP traffic.

461
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:54,056
So a server, because it can do
multiple things, somehow needs

462
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:57,596
to be able to uniquely
identify the various things

463
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,366
that it can do.

464
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:00,976
And so the world introduced
this notion of port numbers.

465
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:06,036
And typically for a web
sever for rather for HTTP,

466
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:08,336
it uses this protocol TCP

467
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:12,036
and the world decided some
years ago the number 80 will

468
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:15,426
arbitrarily but consistently
identify this service.

469
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:18,516
So if you have a server
and you have a website.

470
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,746
And a website uses,
as you probably know,

471
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:22,996
HTTP but we'll look at
what that means in a bit.

472
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:26,406
It is running, so to
speak, on port 80.

473
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,366
It is listening, so
to speak, on port 80.

474
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:30,236
And the motivation for that is

475
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:33,956
because you might also
have an email server

476
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:35,386
on the same physical box, right?

477
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:37,476
Gmail, it's kind of
an oversimplification

478
00:20:37,476 --> 00:20:39,936
but they are both a website
and an email service.

479
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:42,656
And if you want to be able
to send email to Gmail,

480
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:46,386
you can also use TCP but
you have to use port 25.

481
00:20:46,816 --> 00:20:50,526
In other words, if you go
to Gmail.com with a browser,

482
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:51,996
you obviously want
a webpage back.

483
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:54,716
So even though you, the
human haven't typed 80,

484
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:56,226
it's automatically
inserted for you

485
00:20:56,226 --> 00:20:57,926
by your browser behind
the scenes.

486
00:20:58,276 --> 00:21:01,926
But if you sent an email from
Eudora or Apple Mail or Outlook,

487
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:04,196
or whatever you're using,
you again probably don't have

488
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,996
to care about this detail
but that program is going

489
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:11,536
to send data still to Gmail.com
but specifically to port 25.

490
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:14,246
So when a computer is on
the internet, a server

491
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:17,666
and it's listening for traffic,
all of that traffic comes

492
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,786
in on a specific port,
a specific like pathway

493
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:22,486
into the server so that it knows

494
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:24,176
if it's a webpage
or an email, right?

495
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:25,116
Because especially email.

496
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:28,206
Emails can contain HTML
now so you need some way

497
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:30,246
of distinguishing the
two fundamentally.

498
00:21:30,696 --> 00:21:33,176
So when you proposed port
forwarding, what does this mean?

499
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:36,696
Well, if your home network
has a public IP address

500
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,826
and you usually, again,
get one from your ISP,

501
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:44,256
and that is some address of
the form, w.x.y.z, and you,

502
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:46,966
your individual laptop on
which you've created your final

503
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:48,856
project that you want to
make publicly available,

504
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:50,506
is that one of these
IP addresses,

505
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:51,756
doesn't really matter
what it is.

506
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:54,366
What you can do is
configure your home router,

507
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:57,746
a.k.a. firewall, a.k.a. cable
modem, it depends on what make

508
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,966
and model you have but that
device, you can configure it

509
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:04,276
to say, any internet traffic
that comes from the internet

510
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:07,696
to my home on my public
IP address destined

511
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:10,746
for port 80 should
be "port forwarded"

512
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:16,286
to IP address 192.168
dot something port 80.

513
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,076
In other words, you
can tell this machine

514
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:19,896
to take incoming
data on that port

515
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:22,686
and then route it very
specifically to this computer,

516
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:25,266
yours, so that it just works.

517
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:29,226
Now there is one gotcha here,
especially if you have siblings

518
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:31,116
for instance or other
technically minded family

519
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:31,896
members or roommates.

520
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:35,546
If you're doing port
forwarding in this way,

521
00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:39,816
only one of you can operate
a web server behind your

522
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,476
cable model.

523
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:42,516
Because you only
have one IP address

524
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:44,376
to uniquely identify
your website

525
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:46,796
and if you've already
claimed 80 as your own

526
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:49,016
and that's the default for
the world's browsers to use,

527
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:51,606
pretty much only your web
server can be accessed.

528
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,466
Now there is a work around here.

529
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:55,416
If your roommate is really
ticked off at you, you can say,

530
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,796
"Fine, fine, fine, I
will give you port 81."

531
00:22:57,796 --> 00:23:01,126
But what does that mean, that
means the entire world has

532
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:05,816
to type out a URL like let's
say your address was indeed,

533
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:10,346
w.x.y.z this would be
your address, your URL.

534
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:12,506
Your roommate's, unfortunately,

535
00:23:12,506 --> 00:23:13,796
would be this crazy
looking thing.

536
00:23:14,356 --> 00:23:17,626
Right? Or any number
other-- any number really.

537
00:23:17,816 --> 00:23:19,356
Now there are some
restrictions on the numbers.

538
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,206
You just probably can't use
81, but the point is the same.

539
00:23:22,506 --> 00:23:25,056
This is not standard and you
probably don't want your users

540
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:27,136
having to remember
such an esoteric detail

541
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:28,676
as an arbitrary number.

542
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:34,316
However, if on the internet you
visit any website with colon 80,

543
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:36,466
odds are you will
get to the website

544
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:37,676
with which you're familiar.

545
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:39,036
It's just the browser is again

546
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:42,576
for user convenience inserting
the port number automatically

547
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:42,936
for you.

548
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:47,796
And little trivia for HTTPS,
the secure version of HTTP,

549
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:48,836
what port number does that use?

550
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:49,626
>> 443.

551
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:52,866
>> 443. And you sometimes
do see that in URL.

552
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:55,386
You also see some other
ports commonly like 8080.

553
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:58,766
8080 is just kind of an
arbitrary popular port

554
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:00,996
that some company has used
to run certain services.

555
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:03,486
But in short, using anything
nonstandard these days

556
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:05,666
especially for commercial
production websites

557
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,176
where you're trying to
make money or trying

558
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:11,856
to stay online 100% of the time,
using nonstandard ports is bad.

559
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:13,166
Because there are
certain companies,

560
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:13,906
there are certain campuses

561
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:17,916
that will pretty much block
any port besides 80 and 443.

562
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:19,606
But thankfully there's
a work around.

563
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:21,496
Even if you want to
run some random server

564
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:23,176
like a BitTorrent server
or something like that,

565
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:27,436
all you have to do is change
the port number to be 80 or 443.

566
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:29,536
So the reality is
with firewalling,

567
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,606
and we'll have this conversation
toward the end of the semester

568
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,266
when we talk about
security more generally,

569
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:35,766
and a lot of security
mechanisms are kind of a joke

570
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,186
because all you need is a
modicum of savvy or, you know,

571
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,536
having listened to the
past 30 seconds of words

572
00:24:40,536 --> 00:24:42,806
that I just said and you
can circumvent these kinds

573
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:43,906
of restrictions.

574
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:46,236
Hotels do this a lot,
Starbucks does this a lot.

575
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:49,486
But port numbers are really
just this very basic mechanism

576
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:51,106
and the world has
adopted some standards.

577
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:52,546
All right.

578
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,546
So, perfect, we have a solution.

579
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:58,146
All you have to do is
somehow figure out how

580
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:02,746
to download the manual for your
Linksys router or Apple AirPort

581
00:25:02,786 --> 00:25:04,576
and you can configure all
this port forwarding stuff

582
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:05,966
and run a website
from your home.

583
00:25:06,566 --> 00:25:07,736
So not quite, right?

584
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:10,206
Because if you actually have
a popular website, Verizon

585
00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:11,816
and Comcast might
very well notice

586
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:13,106
and just shut you off entirely

587
00:25:13,356 --> 00:25:16,276
because that huge disclosure
agreement you probably clicked

588
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:17,536
through and never read
when you've signed

589
00:25:17,536 --> 00:25:20,576
up for internet service probably
said you may not run a website

590
00:25:20,576 --> 00:25:21,816
on your home computer.

591
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:24,556
So plus this was a pain
in the neck to do anyway.

592
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,266
So we might-- plus I
unplug my laptop sometimes

593
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:29,996
and so my website is going to go
down anytime I go to-- go out.

594
00:25:30,436 --> 00:25:32,716
So not the best solution
even if you have a desktop.

595
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:35,056
So let's at least try to push
a little harder and assume

596
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:37,146
that we need to outsource this
problem or we at least need

597
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:40,406
to put a computer on
the internet itself

598
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:42,776
in a data center, on a campus
where it can stay plugged

599
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:44,576
in perpetually under
your desk at work,

600
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,176
if the sys admins allow it.

601
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:51,136
And moreover, I don't want
my website to live at w.x.y.z

602
00:25:51,136 --> 00:25:52,876
or any number for that matter.

603
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:57,136
I want it to live it, david.com
or some URL that is sort

604
00:25:57,136 --> 00:25:59,376
of distinctly my
brand or my name.

605
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:01,236
So, that begs the
question, how do you go

606
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:04,966
about getting your
own domain name.

607
00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:06,776
Has anyone done this before?

608
00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:08,946
Yeah, how do you it?

609
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:11,336
>> I purchase them.

610
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:12,556
>> OK. Where do you
purchase them?

611
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:14,496
>> I got mine in Namecheap.

612
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:17,786
>> OK so Namecheap.com
is a very popular place,

613
00:26:17,986 --> 00:26:18,786
fairly inexpensive.

614
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,056
GoDaddy is another
very popular place.

615
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:25,636
This one is kind of riddled
with upsell attempts,

616
00:26:25,636 --> 00:26:28,066
trying to get you to buy
everything in the kitchen sink.

617
00:26:28,306 --> 00:26:29,206
But you don't need to do that.

618
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:33,036
There's all sorts of domain name
registrars out there these days.

619
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:34,346
Many-- A bunch of years ago,

620
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,246
Network Solutions
was the only one.

621
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:39,046
But then a market was
created and so there's lots

622
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:40,456
of places to buy domain names.

623
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:42,266
For the most part
it doesn't matter

624
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,006
where you buy your
domain name from.

625
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:45,716
But you do sometimes
get different features.

626
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:49,516
In particular, you get DNS
feature sometimes, more control

627
00:26:49,516 --> 00:26:50,576
over your DNS servers.

628
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:53,236
They might throw in free
email accounts, free hosting

629
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:55,416
but for the most part it
doesn't matter huge amount,

630
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:57,776
in particular you don't
need to go to someone

631
00:26:57,776 --> 00:27:01,066
like Network Solutions and pay
$30 a year when you could go

632
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:03,666
to someone like GoDaddy
and pay 9.99 a year

633
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,216
or Namecheap and
pay 4.99 a year.

634
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:07,806
So in short, just paying more

635
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:10,826
for a domain name isn't
necessarily giving you anything

636
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:14,786
more in the way of
functionality.

637
00:27:14,786 --> 00:27:16,936
It depends on what
maybe the add-ons are.

638
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:19,106
So, how do we go
about doing this?

639
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:20,936
Well, let's go to
something like GoDaddy.

640
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:23,116
GoDaddy is kind of a-- Well,
let's actually try Namecheap.

641
00:27:23,306 --> 00:27:25,596
Let's go to Namecheap and
see what they look like.

642
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:26,306
Namecheap.

643
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,696
Bunch of my friends have
indeed used these websites.

644
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:31,076
All right.

645
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:32,806
So let's see, domain
name to search.

646
00:27:32,806 --> 00:27:36,486
I'm going to search for
david.com, probably taken.

647
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:37,756
Oh, that is a good price.

648
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:39,486
We're already doing
better than GoDaddy.

649
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:42,036
All right, so as I
expected, it is taken,

650
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,076
as are almost all
forms of David.

651
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:48,196
They've suggested I name
myself David John, David Smith,

652
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:51,326
David Johnson, King David,
David photography dot US.

653
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:52,946
So, one of the hardest
things frankly

654
00:27:52,946 --> 00:27:54,986
of starting a business these
days is finding an available

655
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:57,766
domain name, let alone your own
personal vanity domain names

656
00:27:57,766 --> 00:27:58,586
for people's names.

657
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:01,136
But if we found something
we liked,

658
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:05,546
maybe I do want DavidTV
dot-- well, that's atrocious,

659
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:08,316
$6000 for this domain
but if it's not

660
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:11,406
yet taken it's probably one
of the cheaper ones up above.

661
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:13,826
So let's assume we found
something we're happy with.

662
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:16,516
So we add it to our
cart and we check out.

663
00:28:16,816 --> 00:28:19,866
I now own some domain name,
David something dot com.

664
00:28:20,426 --> 00:28:21,886
So what now do I do with it?

665
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:25,266
How do I associate it with my
web server, and for that matter,

666
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:26,146
how do we get a web server?

667
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:27,726
Let's assume I have a web
server and we'll cross

668
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:29,246
that bridge in a moment.

669
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:32,076
But I have a domain name,
what do I need to do

670
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:33,476
with it to start using it?

671
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:36,446
Well, I need to tell the
world what my IP address is.

672
00:28:36,826 --> 00:28:40,656
So I need to somehow tell
the world that my server,

673
00:28:40,656 --> 00:28:42,166
I don't know who's
going to be hosting it

674
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:43,826
but I know it will
have an IP address

675
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:45,176
by nature of how the web works.

676
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:47,506
So let's assume I know
the IP address is going

677
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:51,976
to be w.x.y.z. I somehow have
to inform the whole world

678
00:28:52,116 --> 00:28:56,046
that david.com's IP
address is w.x.y.z. So one

679
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:59,056
of the things I'll have to do
at Namecheap.com or GoDaddy

680
00:28:59,056 --> 00:29:03,886
or networksolutions.com is I
tell the registrar not what my

681
00:29:03,886 --> 00:29:05,866
own computer's IP
address will be

682
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:07,916
but rather what the IP address

683
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:12,626
of my domain name's
DNS servers will be.

684
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:15,376
And the convention is
typically that every domain name

685
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:18,656
in the world should have two DNS
servers, primary and secondary,

686
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:20,396
so a main one and a backup one.

687
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:23,106
They can be one in the same but
the world really pushes people

688
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:25,706
to having at least two for the
sake of uptime and redundancy.

689
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:29,476
So I need to know not my own
IP address per se but I need

690
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,996
to know the IP address of one
and then a second DNS server.

691
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:35,366
Now I don't have my own DNS
servers and I don't want

692
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:37,226
to go have to configure
two more computers

693
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:38,446
in addition to my web server.

694
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,746
So this is where web
hosting companies come in.

695
00:29:41,006 --> 00:29:42,746
So in addition to
buying the domain name,

696
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:45,076
I also want to host
my website somewhere

697
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:47,936
and it could very well be
the same exact company.

698
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:50,346
It could be GoDaddy, it
could be Namecheap depending

699
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:51,876
on the service that
they provide.

700
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,806
But we need to have
a web hosting option.

701
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:57,976
So what's a web host
going to give us?

702
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:02,296
A web host is going to give us
a hard drive to put my files on,

703
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,916
you know, maybe not
a hard drive per se,

704
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,436
but some illusion
of storage space.

705
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:08,366
They are going to have their
own connections to the internet,

706
00:30:08,686 --> 00:30:09,806
this web hosting company.

707
00:30:10,046 --> 00:30:12,066
They are hopefully going to
have a pool of IP addresses

708
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:13,596
so that I can have
at least one of them.

709
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:15,986
They're also going
to have some RAM.

710
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:18,386
They're also going to have
technical support staff.

711
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:20,186
In short, they're going
to have a server and all

712
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:22,806
of the things necessary to keep
a server alive on the internet.

713
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:23,956
And hopefully, they're
also going

714
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,886
to have at least two of what?

715
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:28,696
DNS servers.

716
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:31,176
So if I decide to
host my website,

717
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:32,586
let's say DreamHost.com.

718
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:35,806
This is a very popular
sort of el cheapo kind

719
00:30:35,806 --> 00:30:40,556
of web hosting company that
I've used myself in the past,

720
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:43,576
it's like 6.95 or 8.95 a
month, so that's pretty good,

721
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:44,956
but again, you get
what you pay for.

722
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:47,506
I wouldn't necessarily
build a big business on it.

723
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:51,726
So for 8.95 a month, I have
the ability to upload my HTML

724
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:53,076
and CSS files and soon PHP

725
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:56,116
and JavaScript files
to their server.

726
00:30:56,416 --> 00:31:00,046
Their server has
nearby two DNS servers,

727
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:01,766
each of which have
their own IP addresses.

728
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:05,116
So once I know what
DreamHost's IP addresses are

729
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:07,976
for its name servers, I
tell Namecheap, or GoDaddy

730
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:10,406
or wherever I bought my
domain name, and that's it.

731
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:11,576
The only time I have to talk

732
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:13,886
to my registrar again
most likely is in a year

733
00:31:13,886 --> 00:31:18,366
when they charge me another
5.99 or $99 for my domain name.

734
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:21,036
Unfortunately, buying, you're
really renting your domain name

735
00:31:21,106 --> 00:31:22,046
from these registrars.

736
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:25,116
Now, there's a whole bunch
more involved in setting

737
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,526
up of the web server and
getting my files there,

738
00:31:28,766 --> 00:31:32,036
but at least now I've told the
world that if you want to know

739
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:36,316
where david.com is, ask these
people, these two IP addresses

740
00:31:36,316 --> 00:31:37,646
of the name server, either one.

741
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:41,336
And those IP-- those DNS
servers should hopefully know.

742
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:43,906
Why? Because so long as
I keep paying DreamHost

743
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:47,366
or someone else 8.95 per month,
they will ensure that both

744
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:51,496
of those DNS servers know what
my own website's IP address is.

745
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:52,376
And how will they know?

746
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,146
Because of what I'm paying
for is some storage space

747
00:31:55,276 --> 00:31:57,886
and some internet connectivity
on one of their servers.

748
00:31:57,886 --> 00:31:59,756
One of their servers
has an IP address,

749
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:01,626
so they just tell
their DNS servers

750
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:04,906
that david.com's IP address
is whatever the IP address is

751
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:07,176
of the server they've told
me to put my content on.

752
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:10,376
And we'll actually look
in a little more detail

753
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:13,476
of what's involved in that.

754
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:16,476
But any questions?

755
00:32:16,556 --> 00:32:22,406
So, in answer to the
somewhat frequent problem

756
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:26,126
where a website does work
at www.something.com but not

757
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:28,946
at something.com, how do
you fix something like that?

758
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,886
There's usually two
pieces to the solution.

759
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:34,286
One, you have to make sure
that there's a DNS record

760
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:38,536
for something.com, that is
there's an IP address associated

761
00:32:38,536 --> 00:32:40,466
with it in addition to
one being associated

762
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:44,996
with www.something.com and you
need to configure the web server

763
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:47,966
to accept requests for
either something.com

764
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,976
or www.something.com.

765
00:32:51,246 --> 00:32:55,856
But really, let's focus on
just this DNSPs for now.

766
00:32:56,436 --> 00:33:00,436
So DNS. Turns out DNS is
relatively straightforward,

767
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,786
and once you start operating
a whole bunch of services

768
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:04,986
on your own website, maybe
you have an email server,

769
00:33:05,206 --> 00:33:08,236
maybe you want to use hosted
services like Google Calendar,

770
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:11,456
maybe Google Docs, you
can do things like--

771
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,536
actually for CS-75, for
this course, the TFs

772
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:19,946
and I use Gmail essentially
to host cs75.net's email.

773
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:24,166
So that's the website as
we'll-- as I'll soon reveal,

774
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,846
if you haven't pulled
up the website.

775
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:28,166
And we want to be able to have
an email list so that each

776
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,016
of us can email everyone
else very easily.

777
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:34,026
So we want email addresses
of the form mailing@cs75.net.

778
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:35,356
Now, how do we do this?

779
00:33:35,356 --> 00:33:38,086
Well, we could set up a mail
server, we could pay someone

780
00:33:38,086 --> 00:33:40,886
to do this, but an amazing
servers out there is Google Apps

781
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:43,726
with which some of you might
be familiar, and for small fish

782
00:33:43,726 --> 00:33:45,916
like us, where we only
have a few people on staff,

783
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:49,136
you can actually have hosted
Gmail, hosted Google Calendar,

784
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:53,526
hosted Google Documents for
I think 20 or fewer people

785
00:33:53,586 --> 00:33:56,986
for free, and what you do is you
configure your own DNS servers

786
00:33:57,256 --> 00:34:01,846
to map something
like mail.cs75.net

787
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:04,526
to essentially Gmail.com.

788
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,936
So that whenever we send
an email to something

789
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:10,296
of the form mail.cs75.net,
it figures out via DNS

790
00:34:10,296 --> 00:34:12,076
to actually go to Google.

791
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:15,016
We could have calendar.cs75.net
and you hit enter,

792
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:16,746
you actually end up
at Google Calendar,

793
00:34:16,746 --> 00:34:18,616
but our copy of Google Calendar.

794
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:19,596
And this is all thanks to DNS.

795
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:21,966
And there's only a few
settings with which you need

796
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:23,956
to be familiar, and we
already talked about this one.

797
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:30,096
An NS record is a
record in a DNS server

798
00:34:30,396 --> 00:34:34,346
that tells the world what the
IP address is for that domain.

799
00:34:35,176 --> 00:34:37,356
So, what's inside a DNS server?

800
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:39,746
Frankly, it's a database
and you can think of it

801
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:42,766
as like a database with
Excel files, so spreadsheets

802
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:44,136
that just have rows and columns.

803
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:46,906
And those columns
essentially represent--

804
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,916
well, in each row
rather, you would have

805
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:52,276
for instance a domain
name and an IP address.

806
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:54,476
Domain name, IP address,
domain name, IP address.

807
00:34:54,476 --> 00:34:56,086
That's really all that's
underneath the hood

808
00:34:56,086 --> 00:34:58,526
in a DNS server, at least
so far as we're concerned.

809
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,566
But there are different
types of rows.

810
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:03,876
So one of those rows can
be an official record

811
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,806
that says the name server, NS,

812
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:09,336
for this domain is whatever
IP address DreamHost gave me

813
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:10,226
for instance.

814
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:12,716
Now, what else can I have?

815
00:35:12,926 --> 00:35:14,246
Well, there's an A record.

816
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:18,226
So an A record, a row of
type A in the spreadsheet

817
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:21,116
of sorts is literally
domain name to IP address.

818
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:22,486
It's as simple as that.

819
00:35:22,486 --> 00:35:24,926
So if I have something.com and
its IP address should be x--

820
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:28,026
w.x.y.z, that's what's
called an A record.

821
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:32,316
And I can also have
mail.something.com

822
00:35:32,316 --> 00:35:33,906
or calendar.something.com

823
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:35,806
and I can associate
with an IP address.

824
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:36,736
And how do I do this?

825
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:38,726
It totally depends
on your registrar

826
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:41,006
or on your DNS provider,
whether it's DreamHost

827
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:41,826
or GoDaddy or the like.

828
00:35:42,046 --> 00:35:43,786
But these days, it's
usually a web interface.

829
00:35:43,786 --> 00:35:45,666
Back in the day, it
was a command line,

830
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:47,196
you edit a text file
on a server,

831
00:35:47,196 --> 00:35:49,496
but these days it's been made
to be more user friendly.

832
00:35:49,586 --> 00:35:51,256
But it's essentially
a spreadsheet.

833
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,916
Now, there's two
slightly fancier features.

834
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:58,446
A CNAME or canonical
name is an alias.

835
00:35:58,936 --> 00:36:01,866
So it turns out with a
lot of these web services

836
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:05,516
like Google Apps, where Google
is providing the service,

837
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:07,566
you don't necessarily
want to have

838
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:10,636
to know what Google's
IP address is, right?

839
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,686
Because one, you probably don't
know anyone who works there,

840
00:36:12,686 --> 00:36:13,916
and so you can't
really ask them.

841
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:16,006
Now, frankly, you can run a
command and figure it out,

842
00:36:16,326 --> 00:36:19,906
but if you hardcode into your
DNS server the IP address

843
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:22,656
of google.com, the implication
is that if they ever need

844
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,336
to change their IP address,
which happens, not everyday,

845
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:26,406
but you know, every few months,

846
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:28,636
a few years for whatever
technical reasons,

847
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,336
now your website goes down.

848
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:34,186
It's-- would kind of be better,
at least like it conceptually

849
00:36:34,186 --> 00:36:38,776
if calendar.something.com didn't
resolve to Google's IP address,

850
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:39,876
but rather, what

851
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:43,606
if calendar.google.com could
instead resolve more generically

852
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:46,226
to calendar.google.com.

853
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:49,436
So don't have your domain
mapped to an IP address,

854
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:53,646
have your domain name mapped
to someone else's domain name,

855
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:58,066
and then let their DNS server
tell the world what the current

856
00:36:58,066 --> 00:37:00,606
IP address is of
calendar.google.com.

857
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:03,016
So in other words, if you want
this layer of abstraction,

858
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:06,246
where you don't care what the
IP address is, you just care

859
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:08,056
that your domain
name be a synonym

860
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:11,146
for someone else's domain name,
then you use a CNAME record.

861
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:13,216
And what the two columns
look like are domain name,

862
00:37:13,216 --> 00:37:16,196
domain name instead of
domain name, IP address.

863
00:37:16,616 --> 00:37:19,386
So it's a wonderful useful
feature, especially these days,

864
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:21,296
if you look into
hosted solutions,

865
00:37:21,296 --> 00:37:24,566
not just like Google Apps, but
companies that have services

866
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:27,196
like customer service forums.

867
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:29,556
If you go to a website,
they'll often have an address

868
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:33,086
like support.dell.com or
the like or there's a lot

869
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:33,956
of companies these days

870
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:38,006
that provide customer service
websites, but it would look kind

871
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,696
of lame if I go to dell.com
and I get redirected

872
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:42,136
to customerservice.com.

873
00:37:42,406 --> 00:37:47,086
Dell would rather rebrand
someone else's service to look

874
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:49,366
like Dell even though
someone else implemented it

875
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:50,196
and is hosting it.

876
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:52,756
So via a CNAME, someone

877
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:56,126
like Dell could say
support.dell.com should actually

878
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:59,146
resolve to customerservice.com,
but the user should never know

879
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:01,996
that because the URL
stays support.dell.com.

880
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:03,546
So that's just one of
the things you can do

881
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:05,176
with these things called CNAMEs.

882
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:09,156
And lastly, an MX record
is a mail exchange record.

883
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:12,276
And a mail exchange record
simply states what is the IP

884
00:38:12,276 --> 00:38:15,416
address of the server or servers

885
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:18,436
that should handle inbound
mail for this domain name.

886
00:38:18,436 --> 00:38:22,166
And this is great, because
when you use Eudora or Gmail

887
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:26,856
or Outlook and you type in
deardavidmalin@harvard.edu

888
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:28,946
and hit enter, similarly there,

889
00:38:28,946 --> 00:38:31,306
you have no idea what
Harvard's IP address is,

890
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:33,936
but your computer does,
but it's not the IP address

891
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,386
of harvard.edu per se that
your email client needs,

892
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:40,736
it's the IP address of Harvard's
mail server, so thanks to DNS,

893
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:45,266
your Mac or PC can ask your
ISP's DNS server or dot dot dot,

894
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:47,006
this whole hierarchy
we discussed earlier,

895
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:50,206
can say what is the MX
record for harvard.edu.

896
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:54,916
And harvard.edu's domain's name
server should be able to say

897
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:56,616
"send all mail to
this IP address."

898
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:59,496
And what's nice about MX records
is you can have multiple ones

899
00:38:59,496 --> 00:39:03,916
with priorities, so
websites or rather domains

900
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:06,506
that have very large
numbers of users

901
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:08,616
where you really don't want
their mail servers going down,

902
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:11,446
you can have 2 or 3 or 10
different mail servers,

903
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:14,436
and the DNS system will say,
try this one, then this one,

904
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,536
then this one, then this one,

905
00:39:15,776 --> 00:39:17,646
just in case any of
those go offline.

906
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:18,986
And it's all thanks to DNS.

907
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:21,926
And while we sort of take
all of these for granted,

908
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:24,136
once you start developing
your own websites,

909
00:39:24,136 --> 00:39:27,256
maybe creating your own
companies or contributing back

910
00:39:27,256 --> 00:39:29,886
to your own school, having
these abilities is wonderfully

911
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:33,706
powerful, and it really
boils down to these basics.

912
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:36,156
Any questions?

913
00:39:37,096 --> 00:39:38,146
No? All right.

914
00:39:39,976 --> 00:39:42,286
So that was kind of long.

915
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:44,336
Why don't we take a three
or so minute break here?

916
00:39:44,336 --> 00:39:46,366
There's restrooms in the
hallway, there's soda machines,

917
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:49,126
I think, around the whole
corner, and we'll rejoin

918
00:39:49,126 --> 00:39:50,126
in about three minutes.

919
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:50,766
All right.

920
00:39:52,216 --> 00:39:53,546
We are back.

921
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:56,576
So why don't we take a
look at the course itself

922
00:39:56,576 --> 00:39:59,976
and what you are in for and what
the course's expectations are.

923
00:40:00,186 --> 00:40:01,776
So, in terms of prerequisites,

924
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:03,306
the official prerequisites
are these.

925
00:40:03,306 --> 00:40:05,326
So multiple years of
programing experience as well

926
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:07,806
as comfort with HTML and CSS.

927
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,396
So, what is this
mean in real terms?

928
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:11,226
So, summer school is very short.

929
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:12,496
It's, just about six weeks

930
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:16,176
and the course has three
nontrivially sized projects

931
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:18,376
and the goal really is to
make sure that at the end

932
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:21,526
of the short semester, you feel
quite comfortable going off

933
00:40:21,526 --> 00:40:23,716
and doing much more
on your own in the way

934
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:27,446
of web site development not
just HTML and CSS in the form

935
00:40:27,446 --> 00:40:30,336
of static websites but truly the
dynamic websites that are driven

936
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:34,746
by a language like PHP and
JavaScript back to the database

937
00:40:34,746 --> 00:40:37,816
like MySQL so it's a
fairly intense course.

938
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,616
If you've only taken something
like computer science S1,

939
00:40:42,616 --> 00:40:46,096
the introductory computer
science class or just one

940
00:40:46,096 --> 00:40:48,476
or two courses, I will
say from past experience,

941
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:52,916
you'll probably find the course
challenging to say the least

942
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:56,806
and typically will you estimate
about 30 hours per projects.

943
00:40:56,806 --> 00:40:57,886
So, there's three projects

944
00:40:57,886 --> 00:41:00,176
so you have roughly nine
days for each of them.

945
00:41:00,176 --> 00:41:03,056
It's about 30 hours each
but that was beyond average

946
00:41:03,056 --> 00:41:06,796
so student for whom programming
is a little less familiar

947
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:08,706
or it's been a bunch of
years since you programmed

948
00:41:08,706 --> 00:41:10,776
or you've only taken one
or two introductory courses

949
00:41:10,776 --> 00:41:13,136
but don't really think of
yourself as a programmer,

950
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:15,186
the course is definitely
more challenging.

951
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:17,506
So, do be aware diving in.

952
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:20,786
I will say if you're on
that fence and not sure

953
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:23,016
if you're comfort level
and background is there,

954
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:27,316
you can go to CS75.tv which
is the open courseware site

955
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:30,376
for the course or we have
several previous semesters worth

956
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:33,546
of lecture videos,
hand outs, projects,

957
00:41:33,606 --> 00:41:37,186
some of which will be similar
to the summers so by looking

958
00:41:37,186 --> 00:41:39,066
to the past, you
can perhaps infer

959
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:41,626
as to what the summer will
be like and get a sense then

960
00:41:41,906 --> 00:41:44,996
if the PDFs of past year's
projects completely overwhelm

961
00:41:44,996 --> 00:41:47,676
you or completely excite
you so I would try to use

962
00:41:47,676 --> 00:41:50,946
that as an additional input
tonight before deciding whether

963
00:41:50,946 --> 00:41:52,176
this is the course for you.

964
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:56,076
In terms of expectations
there are these three projects

965
00:41:56,076 --> 00:41:58,926
in attending or watching, if
distant or unable to make it

966
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,806
in person the lectures,

967
00:42:00,806 --> 00:42:03,086
the lectures will be
structured as follows.

968
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:05,746
So, tonight our focus
is on HTTP and sort

969
00:42:05,746 --> 00:42:08,086
of the mechanics the underlying
fundamentals of the internet

970
00:42:08,086 --> 00:42:09,856
that for years you've
probably taken for granted

971
00:42:09,856 --> 00:42:12,386
but once you really start
building your own websites

972
00:42:12,386 --> 00:42:15,256
and having to negotiate things
like configurations of servers

973
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:18,496
and code and databases, tonight
we'll start looking at some

974
00:42:18,496 --> 00:42:19,836
of those more technical details.

975
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:24,466
On Wednesday and next week,
we'll look at PHP itself.

976
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:28,516
So, one of the PHPs most
compelling features these days

977
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:30,906
is one, it's syntactically
very familiar--

978
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:33,866
very similar to languages
with which many of the folks

979
00:42:33,866 --> 00:42:36,806
in this room and at home
are familiar syntactically,

980
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:41,486
it's similar to C and C++ and
other procedural languages.

981
00:42:41,486 --> 00:42:43,776
It's very much in
vague, pretty popular,

982
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:45,626
it's pretty omnipresent
these days in terms

983
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:47,536
of the web hosting companies
that they're out there

984
00:42:47,626 --> 00:42:50,566
and it's super easy to get set
up even Mac OS comes with PHP

985
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:54,376
and Apache, the web server pre
installed and there are packages

986
00:42:54,376 --> 00:42:56,066
for Windows and Linux
and other computers

987
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:58,906
that make it super simple
to get set up in terms

988
00:42:58,906 --> 00:43:01,936
of related languages, Python

989
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:04,546
and Ruby are probably the two
closest contenders in terms

990
00:43:04,546 --> 00:43:06,376
of popularity with PHP.

991
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:08,606
And none of this is necessarily
better than the others.

992
00:43:08,606 --> 00:43:11,276
It could vary quickly devolved
into religious debates but one

993
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:13,726
of the nice things about PHP
is again the omnipresence

994
00:43:13,726 --> 00:43:14,966
of support for it out there

995
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:17,966
and also I think
pedagogically the documentation

996
00:43:17,966 --> 00:43:19,486
for PHP is outstanding

997
00:43:19,486 --> 00:43:24,066
and as you'll see the PHP.net
online reference manual

998
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:26,976
for functions and whatnot
is rich with examples,

999
00:43:26,976 --> 00:43:29,216
intelligent discussions
and so we've just found

1000
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,436
that it's a very
nice way of diving

1001
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:32,986
in deeper to web programming.

1002
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:35,196
And from a course like this, you
should be able to continue on.

1003
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,186
If you haven't come from that
direction already to the likes

1004
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:42,196
of Python and Ruby,
JSP for the JavaWorld,

1005
00:43:42,196 --> 00:43:43,726
ASPs for the Windows's world.

1006
00:43:43,946 --> 00:43:45,906
There's a lot of
commonalities among them.

1007
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:49,166
We'll transition in lecture
three to looking at XML.

1008
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:49,936
So, when it comes time

1009
00:43:49,936 --> 00:43:52,776
to actually stored data whether
statically or dynamically,

1010
00:43:52,776 --> 00:43:54,356
you don't need a
full fledge database.

1011
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:56,066
You don't need MYSQL,
you don't need Oracle,

1012
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,456
you don't need anything
along those lines,

1013
00:43:57,456 --> 00:43:59,506
you could just use text
files but it would be nice

1014
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:02,066
if it's easy to read and
write those text files

1015
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:06,386
so XML is a very popular
language of sort to metalanguage

1016
00:44:06,386 --> 00:44:08,726
with which to write
out textual files

1017
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:10,366
and it's representative
more generally

1018
00:44:10,366 --> 00:44:12,536
of a topic we'll come back
to in our JavaScript lectures

1019
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,716
on the document object model

1020
00:44:14,716 --> 00:44:16,336
so they'll be some
commonalities there.

1021
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:20,426
SQL, structured query
language is what's used

1022
00:44:20,426 --> 00:44:23,936
by many relational databases
these days among them MYSQL,

1023
00:44:24,176 --> 00:44:25,966
Oracle, Postgres and others.

1024
00:44:26,146 --> 00:44:29,716
Also in vogue these
days are NoSQL servers,

1025
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:32,506
document storage engines
which we'll look at later

1026
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:33,736
in the semester as well.

1027
00:44:33,876 --> 00:44:36,216
But we'll primarily use for
the courses projects MySQL,

1028
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:39,136
we'll look in Lecture
6 and 7 a JavaScript

1029
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:41,396
and it is more general
technique of Ajax,

1030
00:44:41,456 --> 00:44:45,096
the ability to use JavaScript
to query a server even

1031
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:47,536
after a page is loaded
to get back more data

1032
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:51,116
for instance Google maps,
does this to get more squares

1033
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:53,426
of mapping information
when you click and drag.

1034
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:56,156
Facebook does this to
push a live updates

1035
00:44:56,156 --> 00:44:57,576
from your News Feed
and the like.

1036
00:44:57,926 --> 00:44:59,686
We'll look through toward
the end of the semester then

1037
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:02,606
at some higher level
concepts like security

1038
00:45:02,606 --> 00:45:04,696
which will interlace
throughout the semester

1039
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:07,516
but we'll really focus on
it in Lecture 8 looking

1040
00:45:07,516 --> 00:45:09,996
at common attacks on web
servers, on web sites,

1041
00:45:09,996 --> 00:45:13,536
on databases, so as to not
necessarily acquaint you

1042
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:15,716
with everything that
can go wrong but to

1043
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:17,266
at least plant the
seeds in your mind

1044
00:45:17,266 --> 00:45:19,026
of things you should
be thinking about.

1045
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:20,776
Indeed there are so
much code out there

1046
00:45:21,046 --> 00:45:23,886
that is just vulnerable because
people don't think do things

1047
00:45:23,886 --> 00:45:26,246
like sanitize user input
that is they don't check it

1048
00:45:26,246 --> 00:45:27,436
for dangerous characters.

1049
00:45:27,716 --> 00:45:30,076
So, we'll talk about things
like SQL injection attacks.

1050
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:33,816
We'll talk about a cross-site
scripting attacks and any number

1051
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:37,246
of other ways that are
so darn easy to avoid

1052
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:39,476
yet many people just
don't realize it

1053
00:45:39,476 --> 00:45:42,746
or don't know how even though
typically simple little function

1054
00:45:42,746 --> 00:45:43,496
calls can fix.

1055
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:45,856
And then the last lecture,
we'll look at scalability.

1056
00:45:45,856 --> 00:45:48,126
So, it would be a great
problem to have if you've got

1057
00:45:48,156 --> 00:45:52,296
so much traffic that all of the
lessons you learn from lecture 0

1058
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:56,686
through 8 starts-- your website
starts crumbling under the load

1059
00:45:56,686 --> 00:45:58,526
and so we'll conclude
the semester by looking

1060
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:01,716
at OK now you have to built
now for a few dozen people,

1061
00:46:01,716 --> 00:46:04,206
a few 100 people at your
school but several 1000

1062
00:46:04,276 --> 00:46:06,776
or maybe even several 1000
people per second how do you

1063
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:10,266
actually scale from one little
web server to a bigger one

1064
00:46:10,466 --> 00:46:11,866
but then once you
have the biggest

1065
00:46:11,866 --> 00:46:14,176
and most expensive available
web server what do you do

1066
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:16,566
but you start to scale
as they say horizontally.

1067
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:19,076
So, you get multiple
servers, maybe even cheaper,

1068
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,606
slower web servers but
you somehow figure out how

1069
00:46:21,606 --> 00:46:24,426
to balance load balance so
to speak traffic across them.

1070
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,786
How do you that with databases
how do you that geographically.

1071
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,846
How do you do that
with cloud computing.

1072
00:46:29,846 --> 00:46:32,006
A buzz word that's all
the rage these days

1073
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:34,126
but has some very interesting
technologies underlying it.

1074
00:46:34,386 --> 00:46:35,486
We'll wrap up the
semester looking

1075
00:46:35,486 --> 00:46:37,626
at those bigger picture issues.

1076
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:42,946
In addition to set a lectures,
we will have most weeks sections

1077
00:46:42,946 --> 00:46:46,356
and office hours so the course
has four teaching fellows,

1078
00:46:46,356 --> 00:46:47,326
folks who way either taught

1079
00:46:47,326 --> 00:46:50,626
or taken the course before
who'll be with us in the form

1080
00:46:50,626 --> 00:46:51,926
of sections and office hours,

1081
00:46:51,926 --> 00:46:54,306
sections will be a more slightly
more intimate opportunity

1082
00:46:54,306 --> 00:46:57,436
so on Wednesdays and Mondays
typically right after lecture

1083
00:46:57,436 --> 00:46:59,396
if you'd like to stick around
to dive a little deeper

1084
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:00,486
into that week's project.

1085
00:47:00,816 --> 00:47:02,926
So in addition to the PDF
specification you'll get

1086
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:03,496
of a project.

1087
00:47:03,756 --> 00:47:06,596
One of the TFs will walk you
through the week's project

1088
00:47:06,596 --> 00:47:09,666
so it give point--
offer some design tips,

1089
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:12,016
some helpful direction,
answer any confusion.

1090
00:47:12,016 --> 00:47:13,986
If I do something quite
poorly in lecture,

1091
00:47:13,986 --> 00:47:16,576
we can revisit those kinds
of topics and sections

1092
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:18,226
so that you get another
perspective altogether

1093
00:47:18,506 --> 00:47:21,646
and then office hours which is
meant to simply follow a section

1094
00:47:21,646 --> 00:47:23,816
so one section officially
wraps after an hour.

1095
00:47:23,946 --> 00:47:27,006
At office hours will be an
opportunity for one on one Q&A

1096
00:47:27,006 --> 00:47:30,126
with one or two of the TFs and
this will be an opportunity

1097
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:32,656
in particular for
questions with the projects

1098
00:47:32,656 --> 00:47:34,426
if you're having trouble
understanding something

1099
00:47:34,426 --> 00:47:37,026
or trouble chasing down some
bug in addition to reaching

1100
00:47:37,026 --> 00:47:39,346
out to us online we'll have
this in person opportunities

1101
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:41,516
for those of who are local, for
those of you who are distant,

1102
00:47:41,806 --> 00:47:44,336
more on the online
opportunities in just a moment.

1103
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:48,906
In addition to the courses'
classes, there are projects,

1104
00:47:48,906 --> 00:47:52,476
three of them and they will
flow roughly in the order

1105
00:47:52,476 --> 00:47:55,286
of the topics on the syllabus
where we'll start in terms

1106
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:58,446
of PHP which would be new to
some or most people in the room,

1107
00:47:58,706 --> 00:48:01,256
then we'll introduce
mid-semester databases

1108
00:48:01,256 --> 00:48:04,766
and MySQL then we'll introduce
JavaScript and Ajax and so

1109
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:07,496
that all essentially be
the tripartite approach

1110
00:48:07,796 --> 00:48:10,616
of the course's projects
in terms of the topics.

1111
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:14,546
In terms of grades, the projects
are graded fairly holistically

1112
00:48:14,546 --> 00:48:16,376
because you'll be
encouraged to make a lot

1113
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:17,966
of design decisions on your own.

1114
00:48:18,216 --> 00:48:19,306
You won't necessarily have

1115
00:48:19,306 --> 00:48:22,906
to implement precisely what we
tell you to rather you'll have

1116
00:48:22,906 --> 00:48:25,166
to meet certain feature
in technical requirements

1117
00:48:25,496 --> 00:48:28,236
so we'll evaluate the three
projects on this axis.

1118
00:48:28,236 --> 00:48:31,536
So, scope will be in axis that
it will be a numeric score

1119
00:48:31,536 --> 00:48:34,926
that captures how much of the
project you actually attempted.

1120
00:48:35,256 --> 00:48:38,516
Correctness will capture
how much of your code works

1121
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,716
in accordance with the
spec. If it's very buggy,

1122
00:48:40,716 --> 00:48:42,306
that would now be
considered very correct.

1123
00:48:42,676 --> 00:48:45,636
Design is more subjective,
design is OK it might work,

1124
00:48:45,636 --> 00:48:47,526
might work perfectly
but does it look

1125
00:48:47,526 --> 00:48:48,756
like a mess underneath the hood.

1126
00:48:48,756 --> 00:48:50,426
Do you have like 10
nested for loops.

1127
00:48:50,456 --> 00:48:52,316
That is not good
design for instance

1128
00:48:52,506 --> 00:48:53,956
and so design would
be an opportunity

1129
00:48:53,956 --> 00:48:55,886
for particularly
qualitative feedback

1130
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:57,426
from the teaching
fellows on your code.

1131
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,696
And style is the more
of the aesthetics

1132
00:49:00,696 --> 00:49:02,556
or your variables
reasonably named

1133
00:49:02,556 --> 00:49:04,116
or is your code well common?

1134
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:05,446
Is it nicely indented?

1135
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:08,886
The sort of easy things that
are good habits to get into even

1136
00:49:08,886 --> 00:49:11,706
if you're not in them that's
what we define a style

1137
00:49:11,896 --> 00:49:13,916
and then just for
reference, things are weighted

1138
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:16,466
and roughly the amount
of time that's required

1139
00:49:16,466 --> 00:49:17,426
to get things right.

1140
00:49:17,796 --> 00:49:20,326
So, for instance this
is the formula we'll use

1141
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:22,326
to compute a total score
for each of the projects,

1142
00:49:22,566 --> 00:49:24,956
where correctness for instance
is weighted more heavily

1143
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:28,886
than style and that should
capture the fact that, you know,

1144
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:31,246
indenting your code probably
shouldn't take you all that long

1145
00:49:31,246 --> 00:49:33,756
but chasing down bugs can
certainly take quite a bit

1146
00:49:33,756 --> 00:49:34,076
of time.

1147
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:36,176
So, the formulas
meant to capture that.

1148
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:39,286
The course's website
which I'll follow

1149
00:49:39,286 --> 00:49:41,676
up in just a moment has
everything that you will need

1150
00:49:41,676 --> 00:49:43,556
for the course including
videos of lectures

1151
00:49:43,556 --> 00:49:45,476
if you can't make some
evening or if it's tricky

1152
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:47,246
because of full time
work, it's totally fine

1153
00:49:47,246 --> 00:49:48,956
to watch the course's
lectures online,

1154
00:49:48,956 --> 00:49:51,256
of the handouts similarly
will be available there.

1155
00:49:51,256 --> 00:49:54,456
What will be rolling out over
e-mail this week is access

1156
00:49:54,456 --> 00:49:57,486
to a tool that I actually
we've used in another class

1157
00:49:57,486 --> 00:49:59,696
of mine called CS50 but
it's a discussion tool

1158
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,336
that will allow you to interact
with classmates, with myself,

1159
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:02,946
with the course's TFs online.

1160
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:06,916
So, online discussion forms
of sorts but using some

1161
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,576
of the same technologies
that we'll talk

1162
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:11,546
about in the class
including Ajax and similar.

1163
00:50:11,746 --> 00:50:14,876
So, you will soon receiving
e-mails from us with invitations

1164
00:50:14,876 --> 00:50:17,726
of sorts to create
accounts within the website

1165
00:50:17,986 --> 00:50:20,056
so that we can-- you can
start directing questions

1166
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:23,816
to classmates or privately to
the staff via CS50 discuss.

1167
00:50:24,226 --> 00:50:26,456
So, any questions
on the structure,

1168
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,986
expectations whether
you're on the right place?

1169
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,256
As to the course itself.

1170
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:34,366
No. All right.

1171
00:50:34,556 --> 00:50:35,796
In terms of-- yeah.

1172
00:50:36,106 --> 00:50:38,296
>> Is there added
credit for attendance?

1173
00:50:38,296 --> 00:50:42,546
>> Nope. Attendance is
expected and you encourage

1174
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:44,886
but it's not factored in.

1175
00:50:45,016 --> 00:50:47,736
So, see you at the end of the
semester, probably, right?

1176
00:50:47,986 --> 00:50:51,356
But in terms of lecture,
typically, we're slated for 3:15

1177
00:50:51,356 --> 00:50:54,066
to 6:15, I think, we're
rarely go all three hours.

1178
00:50:54,066 --> 00:50:57,196
Typically, the same course
during the year is two hours

1179
00:50:57,196 --> 00:50:59,386
of class so we'll typically
have a little bit of wiggle room

1180
00:50:59,386 --> 00:51:01,666
and let me not commit to
just two hours per night

1181
00:51:01,946 --> 00:51:04,626
but we will typically not go I
think as many as three hours.

1182
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:07,746
So, that's frankly a lot to
take in twice a week, no less.

1183
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:12,756
So, we shall see where
we end up each night.

1184
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:15,666
Any other questions?

1185
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:19,506
With regard to sections, the
implication of that detail is

1186
00:51:19,506 --> 00:51:21,516
that sections will
not start necessarily

1187
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:22,696
at the pre-ordained time.

1188
00:51:22,696 --> 00:51:24,686
What we'll try to do is the
TFs will come a bit early

1189
00:51:24,906 --> 00:51:26,436
so if we're doing the
propping of a lecture,

1190
00:51:26,476 --> 00:51:29,716
we'll take a short break then
dive in right immediately

1191
00:51:29,716 --> 00:51:31,816
to section in office hours

1192
00:51:31,816 --> 00:51:33,876
so that you don't sit here
awkwardly just waiting

1193
00:51:33,876 --> 00:51:35,286
for an arbitrary
time to come around.

1194
00:51:35,516 --> 00:51:35,616
Yeah.

1195
00:51:36,216 --> 00:51:37,976
>> How are we then work
with the distance student?

1196
00:51:38,146 --> 00:51:41,416
>> For the distance students,
sections will be filmed as well

1197
00:51:41,486 --> 00:51:44,796
and we will be making ample
use of online interactions

1198
00:51:44,796 --> 00:51:46,496
for students who are
primarily distance

1199
00:51:46,946 --> 00:51:49,936
and we've also experimented in
the past with things like Skype

1200
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:52,246
and video conferencing
or online chats.

1201
00:51:52,246 --> 00:51:53,306
We're quite flexible

1202
00:51:53,356 --> 00:51:55,826
for whatever works
pedagogically for folks,

1203
00:51:55,886 --> 00:51:57,026
>> [Inaudible] distance students

1204
00:51:57,076 --> 00:52:00,376
to attend the section
via chat or something?

1205
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:00,906
>> Good question.

1206
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:03,156
Typically, not for distance
students with sections.

1207
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:05,086
We do film them but
there is some latency

1208
00:52:05,086 --> 00:52:07,566
and when we post them, we
may experiment with trying

1209
00:52:07,566 --> 00:52:09,846
to stream something's online
but this room is not equipped

1210
00:52:09,846 --> 00:52:12,946
for that so, I shouldn't make
promises to that just yet.

1211
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:15,486
But either way things will
be available asynchronously

1212
00:52:15,486 --> 00:52:15,946
after the fact.

1213
00:52:16,326 --> 00:52:16,406
Yeah.

1214
00:52:17,136 --> 00:52:17,966
>> What are the office hours?

1215
00:52:18,556 --> 00:52:20,416
>> The office hours
will typically be right

1216
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,646
after sections on
Mondays and Wednesdays

1217
00:52:22,646 --> 00:52:24,736
which are right after lectures.

1218
00:52:25,096 --> 00:52:27,386
The motivation being especially
for folks who commute,

1219
00:52:27,646 --> 00:52:29,946
we'd figure we try to compact
things to Mondays and Wednesday

1220
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,616
so you don't have to
come to campus yet again.

1221
00:52:32,046 --> 00:52:32,976
And we're flexible too.

1222
00:52:32,976 --> 00:52:35,346
If for instance, you're really
struggling in the class,

1223
00:52:35,346 --> 00:52:37,686
you get lots of questions
or your schedule,

1224
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:39,586
you have a night time
class right afterward,

1225
00:52:39,776 --> 00:52:41,896
we're happy to do things
by appointment as well.

1226
00:52:42,946 --> 00:52:45,026
So, in short, we'll meet
you halfway as best we can.

1227
00:52:46,356 --> 00:52:46,746
All right.

1228
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:48,306
So, web hosting companies.

1229
00:52:48,306 --> 00:52:51,116
We talked earlier about DNS
and sort of getting traffic

1230
00:52:51,196 --> 00:52:53,996
to some destination B
but once they get there,

1231
00:52:53,996 --> 00:52:55,326
what's waiting for the user.

1232
00:52:55,326 --> 00:52:59,206
Where are your HTML and CSS and
soon, PHP files actually store?

1233
00:52:59,516 --> 00:53:02,036
So, this is a little screen shot
from this one company DreamHost

1234
00:53:02,036 --> 00:53:04,376
and I don't necessarily
recommend them over any others

1235
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:06,976
but they're popular and
well-known and super cheap.

1236
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:08,456
And just to give you a
sense of what you get

1237
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:11,666
and what you don't really
get, here is a screen shot

1238
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:14,606
of what you get for
apparently for 8.98 per month.

1239
00:53:14,936 --> 00:53:17,196
So, you apparently get
unlimited terabytes

1240
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:18,876
of disks storage space.

1241
00:53:19,586 --> 00:53:22,216
You get unlimited terabytes
of monthly bandwidth.

1242
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:24,796
You get an unlimited
number of domains hosted,

1243
00:53:24,796 --> 00:53:27,676
you get an unlimited number of
user accounts, e-mail accounts,

1244
00:53:27,676 --> 00:53:30,926
MySQL databases and a
particular distribution

1245
00:53:30,926 --> 00:53:32,186
of Linux called Debian here.

1246
00:53:32,656 --> 00:53:34,256
So, it kind of sounds
too good to be true.

1247
00:53:34,696 --> 00:53:35,746
So, what is the catch here?

1248
00:53:36,036 --> 00:53:38,506
Like that's an amazing
deal for 8.95 a month.

1249
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:39,886
Unlimited everything.

1250
00:53:41,376 --> 00:53:42,936
So, what are some of the catches

1251
00:53:42,936 --> 00:53:44,666
or what are they doing
here technologically

1252
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:45,706
to make this possible?

1253
00:53:45,926 --> 00:53:49,576
>> Well, they're not
alone on their own server.

1254
00:53:49,576 --> 00:53:51,586
They're sharing it a
bunch of other sites.

1255
00:53:51,586 --> 00:53:52,166
>> Exactly.

1256
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:55,586
So, a lot of these web hosting
companies are shared services

1257
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:57,386
whereby you might get this

1258
00:53:57,726 --> 00:53:59,626
but they're also promising
the exact same thing

1259
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:01,906
to 10 other people,
to 100 other people.

1260
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:04,056
Now, it turns out that in HTTP,

1261
00:54:04,106 --> 00:54:06,026
the protocol we discussed
earlier,

1262
00:54:06,396 --> 00:54:07,926
there is a feature these days

1263
00:54:07,926 --> 00:54:09,366
for what's called
virtual hosting.

1264
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:11,146
So, back in the day for the web,

1265
00:54:11,146 --> 00:54:14,286
every website needed a unique
IP address, essentially.

1266
00:54:14,356 --> 00:54:16,776
So, that when you typed in
something dot com you went

1267
00:54:16,776 --> 00:54:19,256
to one website and that
website lived on a server,

1268
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,526
that server had an IP address.

1269
00:54:20,586 --> 00:54:21,866
And if you wanted
a second website,

1270
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,206
you better get a second
server or at least give

1271
00:54:24,206 --> 00:54:25,706
that computer a second
IP address.

1272
00:54:26,036 --> 00:54:28,436
However, in more
recent versions of HTTP,

1273
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:30,546
we'll see through
some experimentation

1274
00:54:30,546 --> 00:54:34,886
with actual browsers, browsers
send another HTTP header.

1275
00:54:34,886 --> 00:54:35,846
They don't just send gets.

1276
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:38,636
They also send a
reminder to the web server

1277
00:54:38,636 --> 00:54:40,616
as to what the user
typed in to the URL

1278
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:44,166
so that you can now have
these days multiple websites.

1279
00:54:44,496 --> 00:54:46,566
Food.com, bar.com, bus.com,

1280
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:48,476
all living on the
same physical server,

1281
00:54:48,716 --> 00:54:50,686
at the exact same IP address

1282
00:54:51,176 --> 00:54:55,086
and because the browsers remind
the server what the user typed

1283
00:54:55,086 --> 00:54:58,956
in, food.com, or, bar.com
or bus.com, the server,

1284
00:54:59,086 --> 00:54:59,846
even though its receiving

1285
00:54:59,846 --> 00:55:02,056
for three different
websites can figure

1286
00:55:02,056 --> 00:55:05,486
out from those so-called headers
what was requested and then,

1287
00:55:05,576 --> 00:55:08,566
return the appropriate
domains homepage.

1288
00:55:08,946 --> 00:55:14,116
So, in this case, that's great
because it makes this possible.

1289
00:55:14,116 --> 00:55:16,176
We only have 4 billion
IP addresses in the world

1290
00:55:16,176 --> 00:55:18,676
and they are legitimately
running out and so,

1291
00:55:18,676 --> 00:55:21,586
this is great that we can
multiplex servers in this way

1292
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:24,186
and put multiple
people, multiple websites

1293
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:25,416
on the same IP address.

1294
00:55:25,816 --> 00:55:28,316
But there's a couple of gotchas,
what's the implication of this,

1295
00:55:29,006 --> 00:55:30,906
the fact that multiple customers
are on the same machine?

1296
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:33,586
>> Well, if one-- well if
the server crashes and all

1297
00:55:33,586 --> 00:55:37,786
of the websites will go down.

1298
00:55:37,976 --> 00:55:39,466
>> Good. So, if the
machine crashes,

1299
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,806
now all of you are affected
rather than just the one.

1300
00:55:42,226 --> 00:55:43,636
>> Contention for resources.

1301
00:55:43,986 --> 00:55:45,656
>> Contention for
resources, right?

1302
00:55:45,696 --> 00:55:49,546
So, you're kind of in bad luck--
a bad place, if for instance,

1303
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:53,116
one of the other customers on
the web server is Facebook.com

1304
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:56,256
or something that achieve
unexpected popularity all

1305
00:55:56,256 --> 00:55:59,126
of a sudden or maybe it's a
website that's really ticked

1306
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:01,116
someone off and is
getting some kind

1307
00:56:01,186 --> 00:56:03,226
of internet biz [phonetic]
attack like a denial

1308
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,916
of service attack because people
are going after that website

1309
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:07,696
and just because your server--

1310
00:56:07,696 --> 00:56:10,806
your website is on the same
server, now, you are down

1311
00:56:10,806 --> 00:56:12,546
or otherwise offline as well.

1312
00:56:12,766 --> 00:56:13,846
Moreover, one of the--

1313
00:56:13,846 --> 00:56:17,846
one of the ways in which
these companies offer

1314
00:56:17,846 --> 00:56:20,166
such discounted prices is
because it's not just you

1315
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:20,976
and two other websites.

1316
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:22,726
It's probably not
10, it could be 100,

1317
00:56:22,726 --> 00:56:26,826
it could be 1000 other customers
on the same server and so,

1318
00:56:26,826 --> 00:56:28,226
there must be some fine print.

1319
00:56:28,226 --> 00:56:30,106
And hopefully, there are
some fine print somewhere

1320
00:56:30,326 --> 00:56:32,816
that does say this is subject
to something or rather, right?

1321
00:56:32,816 --> 00:56:35,236
They don't have infinite
terabytes on their web server.

1322
00:56:35,236 --> 00:56:36,596
They don't have infinite
bandwidth.

1323
00:56:36,596 --> 00:56:38,896
There's got to be some
catch here, otherwise,

1324
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,176
the world will not pay
$1000 a month to host

1325
00:56:41,176 --> 00:56:43,276
to real large scale websites.

1326
00:56:43,636 --> 00:56:45,896
So, you, again, sort of
get what you pay for.

1327
00:56:45,896 --> 00:56:47,106
And this is actually expensive.

1328
00:56:47,106 --> 00:56:49,566
Years ago, I signed up for
some fly by not operation

1329
00:56:49,566 --> 00:56:54,366
for like 2.95 a year to host
my website and it was a website

1330
00:56:54,366 --> 00:56:56,846
that I did not care much
for and that was good

1331
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,046
because it went down
quite a bit.

1332
00:56:58,776 --> 00:57:01,116
So, what they're not
guaranteeing here is unlimited

1333
00:57:01,116 --> 00:57:02,346
uptime for instance.

1334
00:57:02,536 --> 00:57:04,416
So, there is some gotchas.

1335
00:57:04,636 --> 00:57:06,666
But frankly, if you're just
starting small, you just want

1336
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:09,266
to experiment, you need a
place for testing a website

1337
00:57:09,266 --> 00:57:13,616
or you don't-- your 8.95 is more
compelling than several $100

1338
00:57:13,616 --> 00:57:17,306
or even more, this is
certainly quite compelling.

1339
00:57:17,756 --> 00:57:18,546
All right.

1340
00:57:18,886 --> 00:57:21,256
But as an aside things
like e-mail and calendar

1341
00:57:21,256 --> 00:57:22,736
and whatnot there's
other alternatives.

1342
00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:24,506
You don't need to get
those through your web post

1343
00:57:24,506 --> 00:57:26,116
when places like Google exist.

1344
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:30,156
But suppose, you are not so
comfortable with that approach

1345
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:33,016
and you suppose too that
you're not comfortable also

1346
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,986
with the fact that you
do not have any control

1347
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:39,116
over a DreamHost like server
because it's being shared

1348
00:57:39,116 --> 00:57:40,876
by other people and it's
because it's being managed

1349
00:57:40,876 --> 00:57:44,876
by other people which is to
say, if they are running PHP 5.2

1350
00:57:44,936 --> 00:57:46,046
which is a few years old,

1351
00:57:46,686 --> 00:57:49,206
so are you like you
are running PHP 5.2.

1352
00:57:49,206 --> 00:57:50,596
And if you want to
take advantage

1353
00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:53,546
of new language features that
were introduced in PHP 5.3

1354
00:57:53,696 --> 00:57:56,426
and more recently PHP
5.4, you're out of luck

1355
00:57:56,536 --> 00:57:57,226
like you're going to have

1356
00:57:57,226 --> 00:57:59,106
to other fund a new web
post or just deal with it.

1357
00:57:59,106 --> 00:58:01,026
You can't just install
it yourself typically.

1358
00:58:01,356 --> 00:58:03,906
So, it's similarly can you
not upgrade different versions

1359
00:58:03,906 --> 00:58:04,336
of software.

1360
00:58:04,336 --> 00:58:06,726
You can't necessarily
reconfigure the web server

1361
00:58:06,726 --> 00:58:07,366
at will.

1362
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:09,376
Now, they might give
you some form of control

1363
00:58:09,376 --> 00:58:10,846
but you'll reach a point perhaps

1364
00:58:11,226 --> 00:58:12,426
where it's just too
frustrating not

1365
00:58:12,426 --> 00:58:14,296
to have administrative
access to the server.

1366
00:58:14,636 --> 00:58:16,756
So, you can still achieve that.

1367
00:58:16,756 --> 00:58:20,316
So, virtual or private
servers, VPSs or an alternative

1368
00:58:20,316 --> 00:58:21,726
to a shared web hosting model.

1369
00:58:22,316 --> 00:58:25,686
In the VPS world, you
get a dedicated server

1370
00:58:25,686 --> 00:58:27,756
to yourself and sort of.

1371
00:58:28,206 --> 00:58:31,006
You get the illusion of a
dedicated server to yourself.

1372
00:58:31,006 --> 00:58:33,196
So, thanks to a technology,
generically known

1373
00:58:33,196 --> 00:58:37,306
as virtualization, these
days, you can buy a server

1374
00:58:37,376 --> 00:58:40,656
with like a bunch of CPUs or a
bunch of course, lots of RAM,

1375
00:58:40,766 --> 00:58:44,536
lots of disk space and then, you
can run virtualization software

1376
00:58:44,536 --> 00:58:47,336
on it that is something
known generally as hypervisor

1377
00:58:47,596 --> 00:58:51,306
like VMware or Parallels
or VirtualBox.

1378
00:58:51,306 --> 00:58:53,706
There's a whole bunch of these
products, free and commercial

1379
00:58:53,706 --> 00:58:56,986
or like out there that once
you run them and install them

1380
00:58:56,986 --> 00:59:00,666
on a server, on top of that
software, you can then,

1381
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:03,736
install multiple instances of
Windows, multiple instances

1382
00:59:03,736 --> 00:59:06,576
of Linux, multiple instances,
if they allowed it, of Mac OS.

1383
00:59:07,226 --> 00:59:08,516
So you could create the illusion

1384
00:59:08,516 --> 00:59:11,096
of multiple distinct
computers each

1385
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:12,896
of which has its own
user names and passwords,

1386
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:15,536
its own administrative or
so-called root account.

1387
00:59:15,936 --> 00:59:18,186
And even though, they're
sharing the physical hardware,

1388
00:59:18,426 --> 00:59:20,946
they are not sharing
the same software.

1389
00:59:21,096 --> 00:59:24,186
So, what you would get as the
customer is the root log in

1390
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:26,366
or the administrator
log in to your machine.

1391
00:59:26,576 --> 00:59:29,116
Now, there's still the
risk of resource contention

1392
00:59:29,296 --> 00:59:31,066
because these players
too were typically

1393
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:33,806
over provision especially if
you're spending, you know,

1394
00:59:33,806 --> 00:59:38,466
9.95 a month and not a 159.95
a month, you're probably going

1395
00:59:38,466 --> 00:59:40,506
to be on a server
with fewer resources

1396
00:59:40,506 --> 00:59:41,716
or with more customers.

1397
00:59:41,966 --> 00:59:43,526
But at least here,
you gain something.

1398
00:59:44,446 --> 00:59:45,876
And if you've been
following along,

1399
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,306
what is that fundamentally
you're gaining from a VPS

1400
00:59:48,306 --> 00:59:50,066
that you didn't get
from a web post?

1401
00:59:50,106 --> 00:59:54,686
>> You can choose to update
things, however you wish.

1402
00:59:54,686 --> 00:59:55,216
>> Exactly.

1403
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:55,616
>> -- to update.

1404
00:59:55,856 --> 00:59:56,386
>> Control.

1405
00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:57,906
You can keep things up to date,

1406
00:59:57,906 --> 01:00:00,006
you can install whatever
you want and also,

1407
01:00:00,276 --> 01:00:04,356
if someone else's server is
compromised odds are your is

1408
01:00:04,626 --> 01:00:06,196
might not be whereas

1409
01:00:06,196 --> 01:00:09,176
of web hosting server is
compromised everything

1410
01:00:09,176 --> 01:00:11,756
on that server is
potentially vulnerable.

1411
01:00:12,496 --> 01:00:14,346
So still not perfect
because the reality is

1412
01:00:14,346 --> 01:00:17,496
to even know you are the
only one now with root

1413
01:00:17,496 --> 01:00:20,846
or administrative access because
it is a dedicated albeit virtual

1414
01:00:20,846 --> 01:00:22,846
server for you that
to you is kind

1415
01:00:22,846 --> 01:00:24,436
of a white lie who
else has access?

1416
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:26,116
>> The people there.

1417
01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:27,196
>> The people there.

1418
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:30,966
Even if they don't know your
password they have physical

1419
01:00:30,966 --> 01:00:32,416
access to the machine
and as soon as you

1420
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:34,106
as your physical
access to any machine

1421
01:00:34,176 --> 01:00:36,636
in the world pretty much
you can compromise it.

1422
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:38,836
You can boot-- you know, Linux
computer for instance can booted

1423
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:40,296
in what's called
single user mode

1424
01:00:40,586 --> 01:00:43,046
by pretty much hitting the
letter S when it's booting up

1425
01:00:43,046 --> 01:00:45,496
and that circumvents
any request for password

1426
01:00:45,496 --> 01:00:46,696
at which point you
can even change it.

1427
01:00:46,696 --> 01:00:50,356
Even on PCs and computers
you can usually reset certain

1428
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:53,796
passwords by opening the case up
putting a little metal connector

1429
01:00:53,796 --> 01:00:55,396
on two pins and it
short circuits

1430
01:00:55,396 --> 01:00:57,086
out the password
and clears it out.

1431
01:00:57,456 --> 01:00:59,646
So in short physical
access bad for security

1432
01:00:59,886 --> 01:01:03,286
so you're not gaining more
security fundamentally,

1433
01:01:03,456 --> 01:01:05,336
you're just making
it less likely

1434
01:01:05,336 --> 01:01:08,296
that someone else is
compromised will affect you.

1435
01:01:08,546 --> 01:01:10,956
And in some of these
system some software

1436
01:01:11,196 --> 01:01:14,716
that system administrators
will have the password

1437
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:17,586
or at least access to the
root account on your server

1438
01:01:17,806 --> 01:01:20,846
so in short you should just
assume that this is for you

1439
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:23,826
but it probably at least one
other person could physically

1440
01:01:23,826 --> 01:01:25,396
access your contents.

1441
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,286
So what do you get though
for the money, well here

1442
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:31,376
and frankly these numbers
are a little more compelling

1443
01:01:31,376 --> 01:01:33,526
because is not unlimited
so I'm kind of incline

1444
01:01:33,526 --> 01:01:35,496
to believe a bit more
about the quality

1445
01:01:35,496 --> 01:01:38,256
of service we're getting here
but 20 gigabytes of storage,

1446
01:01:38,256 --> 01:01:38,796
you know, that's fine

1447
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:42,266
for typical website unless your
website has a ridiculous amount

1448
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:45,366
of traffic and database traffic
and logs which could build up

1449
01:01:45,366 --> 01:01:47,386
and start taking megs
or gigabytes of space.

1450
01:01:47,706 --> 01:01:50,206
Or if you allow users
to upload files

1451
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,376
or photos then you might
need a lot of space

1452
01:01:52,606 --> 01:01:55,306
but many websites even if
they are dynamic this is

1453
01:01:55,306 --> 01:01:56,266
probably plenty.

1454
01:01:56,606 --> 01:02:00,196
Transfer is an interesting one,
20, 200 gigabytes per month,

1455
01:02:00,746 --> 01:02:03,326
for most websites that's
probably fine unless your

1456
01:02:03,326 --> 01:02:04,806
website is photo website

1457
01:02:04,806 --> 01:02:08,156
or worst a video website then
you have to start to do the math

1458
01:02:08,446 --> 01:02:10,236
and figure out exactly
how much trend--

1459
01:02:10,236 --> 01:02:12,786
data will be coming in and
out of your server based

1460
01:02:12,786 --> 01:02:15,726
on users patterns and moreover
there's also corner cases

1461
01:02:15,726 --> 01:02:17,326
as we'll discuss toward
the end of the semester,

1462
01:02:17,326 --> 01:02:19,006
you got to worry about
the bad guys out there.

1463
01:02:19,266 --> 01:02:21,416
If someone just doesn't
like you or is bored

1464
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:24,616
or downloads some free piece
of software that bangs up--

1465
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,766
bangs the heck out of your
computer they could just eat

1466
01:02:26,766 --> 01:02:29,266
up your monthly allotment
of bandwidth just

1467
01:02:29,266 --> 01:02:30,936
by sending bogus traffic

1468
01:02:30,936 --> 01:02:33,596
or downloading the same video
again and again and again.

1469
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,416
So there's very interesting
adversarial tax

1470
01:02:36,706 --> 01:02:40,846
when you have finances somehow
tied to usage so you need

1471
01:02:40,846 --> 01:02:42,706
to be aware of that
especially with cloud computing.

1472
01:02:42,706 --> 01:02:46,956
And let's see you get some
amount of RAM 512 megabytes here

1473
01:02:47,156 --> 01:02:48,576
and so forth one of
the things we'll look

1474
01:02:48,576 --> 01:02:50,176
at during the semester
is we start playing

1475
01:02:50,176 --> 01:02:51,996
with Apache is it will
give you the sense

1476
01:02:52,056 --> 01:02:55,286
of how you can asses how much
RAM your computer is using how

1477
01:02:55,286 --> 01:02:56,606
much disk space its using.

1478
01:02:56,926 --> 01:02:58,816
I dare say one of the
most of common platforms

1479
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:01,666
for web hosting these
days whether it's a VPS

1480
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:05,856
or it is a shared
web post is Linux

1481
01:03:05,856 --> 01:03:10,166
in some form whether it's Debian
or Fedora or Ubuntu or Red Hat

1482
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:12,586
or CentOS or any number--
versions of Linux.

1483
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:15,856
We'll happen to use Fedora in
the class but its representative

1484
01:03:15,856 --> 01:03:18,456
of many similar operating
systems.

1485
01:03:18,726 --> 01:03:21,556
You can use Mac OS but it's
not really use commercially

1486
01:03:21,556 --> 01:03:22,606
through host websites just

1487
01:03:22,606 --> 01:03:25,056
because is not really
geared toward that.

1488
01:03:25,346 --> 01:03:28,506
You can use Windows but you
really-- there's no good reason,

1489
01:03:28,786 --> 01:03:31,136
there's no technically
compelling reason

1490
01:03:31,136 --> 01:03:33,866
to use a Windows machine to
host things like PHP or Python

1491
01:03:33,866 --> 01:03:36,286
or Ruby because you're paying
money for Windows license

1492
01:03:36,286 --> 01:03:39,096
to run free software so it's not
necessarily compelling unless

1493
01:03:39,096 --> 01:03:40,266
you already have the licenses

1494
01:03:40,266 --> 01:03:42,896
and have the machines
generally going

1495
01:03:42,896 --> 01:03:47,076
with these open source tools
is quite common and compelling

1496
01:03:47,076 --> 01:03:48,426
because none of the
software were used

1497
01:03:48,426 --> 01:03:50,826
in the course costs
any money or whatsoever

1498
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:53,416
and it's nonetheless
quite popular and robust.

1499
01:03:54,156 --> 01:03:58,886
All right so what
else, the appliance,

1500
01:03:59,036 --> 01:04:01,306
so we won't introduce it
tonight but we will in the form

1501
01:04:01,306 --> 01:04:04,506
of the first project so that you
have an experience in the class

1502
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:06,576
that is as realistic
as possible.

1503
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:07,576
What we'll actually have each

1504
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:09,816
of you do is run
your own web server

1505
01:04:09,816 --> 01:04:11,406
and run your own
data base server

1506
01:04:11,406 --> 01:04:13,736
and actually run your
own copy of Linux itself.

1507
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,196
For this we'll use another
tool that I used in other class

1508
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:17,716
of mine called the
CS50 Appliance,

1509
01:04:17,856 --> 01:04:20,876
and this will be a
downloadable file that inside

1510
01:04:20,876 --> 01:04:22,766
of which is an installation
of Linux,

1511
01:04:22,766 --> 01:04:25,636
Fedora Linux specifically,
but also installed for you

1512
01:04:25,636 --> 01:04:27,256
in advance will be a Apache

1513
01:04:27,256 --> 01:04:29,126
which is web server
software MySQL

1514
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:32,976
which is data base software, PHP
as well as support for bunches

1515
01:04:32,976 --> 01:04:35,306
of other languages and
standard tools and the like,

1516
01:04:35,596 --> 01:04:37,686
and the upside of this is that
rather than have you connect

1517
01:04:37,686 --> 01:04:39,886
for instance to some
random Harvard servers

1518
01:04:39,886 --> 01:04:42,126
on which you'll only
have temporary access,

1519
01:04:42,506 --> 01:04:44,556
this is a virtual machine
that you have on your computer

1520
01:04:44,556 --> 01:04:46,106
for as long as you
want to keep it around

1521
01:04:46,106 --> 01:04:48,466
and it's very representative
of the configuration.

1522
01:04:48,696 --> 01:04:51,616
You would find out of VPS
or the commercial web post.

1523
01:04:51,616 --> 01:04:54,206
And because you'll
have root access on it

1524
01:04:54,206 --> 01:04:55,306
and because it will be leave

1525
01:04:55,306 --> 01:04:58,256
on your machine only you
have perfectly secure access

1526
01:04:58,256 --> 01:05:01,556
to it unless your laptop
or desktop is compromised

1527
01:05:01,756 --> 01:05:05,236
and you'll be able to configure
Apache and PHP and really tinker

1528
01:05:05,236 --> 01:05:08,786
with things and best get--
best yet if screwed it up,

1529
01:05:08,886 --> 01:05:11,136
that's fine, just download a new
one and you're back to a sort

1530
01:05:11,136 --> 01:05:13,286
of the beginning so long
as you've saved your code

1531
01:05:13,286 --> 01:05:15,746
at somewhere which
will encourage you how

1532
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:16,626
and where to do.

1533
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:20,076
So more than that in a week
or so, how would you connect

1534
01:05:20,076 --> 01:05:21,876
to this kind of thing, so SSH.

1535
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:25,636
Does anyone use-- Does
anyone not use SSH here?

1536
01:05:25,696 --> 01:05:28,416
There is going to be some hands?

1537
01:05:29,356 --> 01:05:32,346
OK. So if you haven't used
SSH, stands for secure shell

1538
01:05:32,586 --> 01:05:35,296
and this is a way,
sort of old school way

1539
01:05:35,296 --> 01:05:38,836
but now a much more secure of
connecting to a remote server

1540
01:05:38,836 --> 01:05:40,236
and executing commands on it.

1541
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,706
So this is just a free program
that comes with MacOS Terminal

1542
01:05:44,036 --> 01:05:46,666
and there is analogs for the
windows or a patti [phonetic].

1543
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:49,226
It's a free program for windows
that a lot of people like to use

1544
01:05:49,516 --> 01:05:51,376
and it allows you to open
up essentially a black

1545
01:05:51,376 --> 01:05:54,816
and white window or white
and black window and type

1546
01:05:54,816 --> 01:05:57,676
in a username and password,
connect to some remote server

1547
01:05:57,756 --> 01:05:59,306
and execute commands on it.

1548
01:05:59,306 --> 01:06:01,246
And those commands can
be to create files,

1549
01:06:01,246 --> 01:06:04,296
remove files configure the
web server, turn the database

1550
01:06:04,296 --> 01:06:05,646
on or off for the like.

1551
01:06:06,026 --> 01:06:08,866
So what you'll find, once we
start using this CS50 appliance

1552
01:06:08,866 --> 01:06:10,516
or virtual machine,
albeit running

1553
01:06:10,516 --> 01:06:13,666
on your own computer not some
server is you will be able

1554
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:17,286
to connect to that appliance
as though it's a remote server.

1555
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:20,616
So that you never even need
to see the appliance itself.

1556
01:06:20,616 --> 01:06:23,286
Literally, once you turn it on,
you can minimize it and pretend

1557
01:06:23,286 --> 01:06:24,966
that it's a server
somewhere else in the internet

1558
01:06:25,136 --> 01:06:26,766
because once you install
it, the appliance,

1559
01:06:27,336 --> 01:06:30,196
a.k.a. virtual machine is going
to have its own IP address

1560
01:06:30,716 --> 01:06:32,946
but it's going to be
what type of IP address?

1561
01:06:33,796 --> 01:06:36,366
So it will be private
to your own laptops

1562
01:06:36,366 --> 01:06:38,576
and no one else can even access
it but you'll be able to go

1563
01:06:38,576 --> 01:06:41,146
through precisely the same
motions that you would

1564
01:06:41,186 --> 01:06:44,026
if you're actually paying some
third party to host your website

1565
01:06:44,026 --> 01:06:46,936
or if you own some server
else where on the internet.

1566
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,036
So SSH will be one of the
techniques that we use.

1567
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:52,106
SFTP for those unfamiliar,
this is screen shot

1568
01:06:52,106 --> 01:06:55,206
of a popular windows client
for transferring files,

1569
01:06:55,206 --> 01:06:58,006
called secure effects but others
exist, free ones in particular,

1570
01:06:58,006 --> 01:07:01,086
it just let's you drag and
drop files from your computer

1571
01:07:01,086 --> 01:07:03,866
to a server but in this
case, the server is going

1572
01:07:03,866 --> 01:07:06,276
to be a virtual machine
running on your own computer

1573
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:08,676
that maybe-- maybe or
maybe not is minimized.

1574
01:07:08,926 --> 01:07:13,176
But again, the experience
would be precisely the same.

1575
01:07:13,366 --> 01:07:15,576
So where does that leave us?

1576
01:07:15,936 --> 01:07:20,096
So it turns out when
you are writing HTML,

1577
01:07:20,886 --> 01:07:24,786
you have fairly static content
but you do have these mechanisms

1578
01:07:24,786 --> 01:07:27,536
and I'm guessing most people
in the room have some or a lot

1579
01:07:27,536 --> 01:07:31,236
of experience with HTML and
basic websites and the like.

1580
01:07:31,466 --> 01:07:35,086
But these ultimately are
the basic input mechanism

1581
01:07:35,086 --> 01:07:38,076
by which we can start
making dynamic websites.

1582
01:07:38,076 --> 01:07:40,826
In other words, we have text
fields, password fields,

1583
01:07:40,826 --> 01:07:43,706
hidden fields, checkboxes,
radio buttons, drop down menus,

1584
01:07:43,906 --> 01:07:47,386
so these are the mechanisms by
which we can start to get input

1585
01:07:47,386 --> 01:07:49,996
from users so that when they
interact with our website,

1586
01:07:49,996 --> 01:07:52,766
they don't necessarily see the
same thing rather they might see

1587
01:07:52,766 --> 01:07:55,496
different things every
time we visit that website.

1588
01:07:55,496 --> 01:07:57,746
So let's do a little
example here.

1589
01:07:58,166 --> 01:07:59,716
I'm going to go ahead and--

1590
01:07:59,936 --> 01:08:01,306
don't download this
on your own just

1591
01:08:01,306 --> 01:08:04,256
yet because we will be
posting a newer version soon--

1592
01:08:04,616 --> 01:08:09,696
but I'm going to go ahead and
open up a program called fusion,

1593
01:08:10,406 --> 01:08:13,176
VMWare fusion, this is what's
called generally again a

1594
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:16,146
hypervisor virtualization
software,

1595
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:19,416
and what I've just done
is essentially run Linux

1596
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:21,706
on my own Mac and
you too can do this.

1597
01:08:21,706 --> 01:08:23,726
I'm going to actually use
the Linux desktop just

1598
01:08:23,726 --> 01:08:26,236
because it's here but I could
similarly minimize it as I will

1599
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:28,266
in just a few minutes and
we'll connect to it as well.

1600
01:08:28,586 --> 01:08:31,006
So now, I'm running
Linux on my same computer

1601
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:32,556
and notice I currently
have no IP address

1602
01:08:32,556 --> 01:08:35,046
but this should change in a
few seconds once I get a--

1603
01:08:35,046 --> 01:08:35,996
there we go.

1604
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:40,096
So my Linux computer virtual
machine has just asked the

1605
01:08:40,096 --> 01:08:42,276
network to give me an
IP address and it came.

1606
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:44,476
The protocol that computers used

1607
01:08:44,476 --> 01:08:49,716
to get IP addresses
dynamically, does anyone know?

1608
01:08:49,716 --> 01:08:52,466
DHCP, Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol, that's what did that.

1609
01:08:52,636 --> 01:08:55,036
It's also how your own
personal computer works at home

1610
01:08:55,036 --> 01:08:57,216
and gets an IP address
from your Linksys router

1611
01:08:57,416 --> 01:08:58,576
or AirPort Extreme.

1612
01:08:58,956 --> 01:09:01,936
So I'm going to go
ahead and do this.

1613
01:09:02,406 --> 01:09:04,156
First let me go to
my, back to my Mac.

1614
01:09:04,156 --> 01:09:07,106
I'm going to open up the
simplest of programs text edit

1615
01:09:07,106 --> 01:09:08,876
which is what we used
earlier and I'm going

1616
01:09:08,876 --> 01:09:10,526
to just make a very
simple web page.

1617
01:09:10,866 --> 01:09:14,526
First, I'm going
to do DOCTYPE html.

1618
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:18,026
So in the course, we'll use html
5 which is sort of the latest

1619
01:09:18,026 --> 01:09:25,136
and greatest version of html
and I'm going to say "Hello."

1620
01:09:25,386 --> 01:09:26,066
Well, let's do this.

1621
01:09:26,726 --> 01:09:34,246
Let's call this Google and
the body and then close body

1622
01:09:34,316 --> 01:09:38,606
and then I'm going to
say Google, h1, OK,

1623
01:09:38,786 --> 01:09:40,216
I'm going to save this.

1624
01:09:40,216 --> 01:09:41,796
I'm just going to
go ahead and save it

1625
01:09:41,796 --> 01:09:44,376
on my desktop as Google.html.

1626
01:09:44,376 --> 01:09:47,766
I'm going to say yes use html
even though it's a text file

1627
01:09:48,056 --> 01:09:51,066
and now I'm going to go ahead
and pull up Google.html.

1628
01:09:52,206 --> 01:09:55,736
OK. So not exactly Google just
yet, I can do a little better

1629
01:09:55,736 --> 01:09:57,136
so let's make this
a little different.

1630
01:09:57,136 --> 01:10:03,036
So let me go in here, div
style, text-align: center.

1631
01:10:04,406 --> 01:10:06,906
So if any of these looks
completely cryptic or new,

1632
01:10:06,906 --> 01:10:08,866
these are the kinds of things
that we will take for granted

1633
01:10:08,866 --> 01:10:10,546
in the course, that this
stuff looks familiar.

1634
01:10:10,826 --> 01:10:11,896
So let me save and reload.

1635
01:10:11,896 --> 01:10:13,866
OK. Now, it looks a
little more like Google

1636
01:10:13,866 --> 01:10:16,956
but it's certainly lacking in
some key features among them.

1637
01:10:18,076 --> 01:10:19,396
All right, search bar, right?

1638
01:10:19,566 --> 01:10:20,366
So let's go there.

1639
01:10:20,366 --> 01:10:23,566
So let me start to make a simple
webpage that again odds are many

1640
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:25,806
of you could have done
already because you know HTML

1641
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:26,856
and forms and whatnot.

1642
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:28,146
So, let's go ahead and do this.

1643
01:10:28,146 --> 01:10:30,746
So down here, I'm
going to say form,

1644
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:34,026
I'm going to close my form,
I'm going to go in here

1645
01:10:34,696 --> 01:10:37,686
and I need an input
type equals text

1646
01:10:38,826 --> 01:10:41,056
and I probably need
a submit button,

1647
01:10:41,126 --> 01:10:45,146
so let me do input
type equal submit

1648
01:10:45,146 --> 01:10:47,886
and I'll give this a
value of Google search,

1649
01:10:47,886 --> 01:10:51,106
what we really recreated as
best we can, save and reload.

1650
01:10:51,106 --> 01:10:52,606
OK. So now, it's getting there.

1651
01:10:52,866 --> 01:10:54,596
You know, this isn't
the prettiest thing,

1652
01:10:54,596 --> 01:11:01,506
so let me go ahead and do style
with let's say 200 pixels.

1653
01:11:01,936 --> 01:11:03,396
Let's go back here and save

1654
01:11:03,396 --> 01:11:05,706
and it's still a little
small, 300 pixels.

1655
01:11:05,986 --> 01:11:07,366
OK, looks more Google like.

1656
01:11:07,366 --> 01:11:11,736
And then if we really want to
be anal here, we could do this.

1657
01:11:13,296 --> 01:11:16,206
I'm feeling lucky, OK.

1658
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,496
So now we've got roughly
Google but in black in white.

1659
01:11:18,956 --> 01:11:21,126
So unfortunately, it
takes way more work

1660
01:11:21,126 --> 01:11:22,906
to implement the
backend of this website.

1661
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:24,216
Right? So front end,
pretty easy.

1662
01:11:24,216 --> 01:11:26,136
We're pretty much done
other than some colors

1663
01:11:26,136 --> 01:11:27,516
and some other features
these days.

1664
01:11:27,896 --> 01:11:28,846
But what about the backend?

1665
01:11:29,096 --> 01:11:31,276
So if I actually wanted
to patch in to Google,

1666
01:11:31,276 --> 01:11:32,586
let's see if we can now revisit

1667
01:11:32,586 --> 01:11:34,186
that conversation
we started earlier.

1668
01:11:34,186 --> 01:11:36,616
When I type www.google.com
and hit enter,

1669
01:11:36,996 --> 01:11:38,036
what really is happening?

1670
01:11:38,036 --> 01:11:39,346
Let's take a look
underneath the hood.

1671
01:11:39,346 --> 01:11:41,346
Let's look at the
HTTP traffic and think

1672
01:11:41,346 --> 01:11:43,416
about what it is we're going
to start building next week

1673
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:44,906
in terms of the actual backend.

1674
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:47,956
So let's suspend
this mental thread,

1675
01:11:48,356 --> 01:11:53,446
pull up the actual google.com
and take a look at what is here.

1676
01:11:53,696 --> 01:11:58,566
I'm going to ahead first so
that this is enlightening.

1677
01:11:58,696 --> 01:12:02,636
They hid it so we have

1678
01:12:02,636 --> 01:12:04,736
to disable this annoying
instant search feature.

1679
01:12:06,226 --> 01:12:07,526
Let's select this.

1680
01:12:08,686 --> 01:12:12,116
Gear icon, search settings,

1681
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:17,836
Google instants, how
do I disable you.

1682
01:12:18,716 --> 01:12:20,366
Never show instant results.

1683
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:22,636
So the reason I want to do
this is we're not going to talk

1684
01:12:22,636 --> 01:12:24,796
about JavaScript and
AJAX, the technologies

1685
01:12:24,796 --> 01:12:26,686
that underlie this annoying

1686
01:12:26,686 --> 01:12:28,516
or beneficial instant
search feature.

1687
01:12:28,516 --> 01:12:31,376
We want to do sort of old
school HTTP searches right now.

1688
01:12:31,646 --> 01:12:32,686
So I've disabled that.

1689
01:12:33,126 --> 01:12:34,976
So now hopefully, I can save.

1690
01:12:35,466 --> 01:12:38,096
OK. Now, I'm going to
go back to google.com

1691
01:12:38,096 --> 01:12:39,866
and this is what it was like
five years ago when you wanted

1692
01:12:39,866 --> 01:12:40,996
to search for something
on the internet.

1693
01:12:41,366 --> 01:12:44,246
So now, I'm going to go ahead
and type for instance Harvard.

1694
01:12:44,506 --> 01:12:46,436
So it's still doing
auto complete

1695
01:12:46,436 --> 01:12:48,316
but it's not immediately
showing me the search results.

1696
01:12:48,546 --> 01:12:53,086
So now, notice before, here
is URL I'm at, www.google.com.

1697
01:12:53,326 --> 01:12:56,816
And now after, let me hit
enter, now notice the URL.

1698
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,446
So this is now hinting

1699
01:12:59,446 --> 01:13:02,326
at the fundamental
functionality of HTTP.

1700
01:13:02,326 --> 01:13:05,276
We have just issued one
of those get requests.

1701
01:13:05,526 --> 01:13:06,636
We had two of them in fact.

1702
01:13:06,746 --> 01:13:09,546
The first one came up when I
visited the homepage then I hit

1703
01:13:09,546 --> 01:13:10,586
enter and it appears

1704
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,396
that another get
request has been sent.

1705
01:13:12,816 --> 01:13:14,506
Why? Because my URL changed.

1706
01:13:14,696 --> 01:13:17,836
So generally, anytime the
keyword get is involved,

1707
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:20,276
it's because the URL is
changing or equivalently

1708
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:22,576
if the URL changes, you
just did a get most likely.

1709
01:13:22,976 --> 01:13:25,096
So there is a whole lot of
distracting stuff up there

1710
01:13:25,096 --> 01:13:28,466
but what is relevant
and what looks familiar

1711
01:13:28,466 --> 01:13:33,176
up there in the URL in gray?

1712
01:13:33,396 --> 01:13:34,786
I have no idea what HL is.

1713
01:13:35,866 --> 01:13:36,876
Sites, I don't know.

1714
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:37,696
Source, I don't know.

1715
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:38,536
But what looks familiar?

1716
01:13:39,266 --> 01:13:40,026
OK. Harvard.

1717
01:13:40,186 --> 01:13:42,636
So let me delete
manually all the stuff

1718
01:13:42,636 --> 01:13:45,486
that I have no idea what
it means, at least not yet.

1719
01:13:45,486 --> 01:13:47,136
So let me, I don't
know what this is.

1720
01:13:47,536 --> 01:13:49,166
Q equals Harvard that I--

1721
01:13:49,386 --> 01:13:51,936
oq equals Harvard,
oq, I don't know.

1722
01:13:51,936 --> 01:13:54,996
I'm just going to presumptuously
whittle it down to that

1723
01:13:54,996 --> 01:13:55,916
and now let's hit enter.

1724
01:13:56,316 --> 01:13:59,116
So interestingly, still
works and what's nice is

1725
01:13:59,116 --> 01:14:00,306
that there is much
less distraction

1726
01:14:00,306 --> 01:14:01,666
and we can have the same story

1727
01:14:01,736 --> 01:14:03,896
but with fewer distractions
in the tail.

1728
01:14:04,276 --> 01:14:08,036
So it looks like when hitting
enter on the previous page,

1729
01:14:08,036 --> 01:14:10,276
if I throw away the
distractions,

1730
01:14:10,886 --> 01:14:14,386
I have now visited, not
slash but slash search,

1731
01:14:14,756 --> 01:14:16,896
question mark, q equals Harvard.

1732
01:14:17,016 --> 01:14:17,816
So what is q?

1733
01:14:17,816 --> 01:14:20,316
Q is generally known
as an HTTP parameter.

1734
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,176
So it is an input
to a web server

1735
01:14:22,336 --> 01:14:23,796
that generally comes
from a form.

1736
01:14:23,796 --> 01:14:24,866
But as we'll see in a few weeks,

1737
01:14:24,866 --> 01:14:26,256
it can also come
from JavaScript code.

1738
01:14:26,256 --> 01:14:27,866
It doesn't have to come
from a form per se.

1739
01:14:28,106 --> 01:14:29,786
Harvard is obviously
what I typed in.

1740
01:14:29,976 --> 01:14:31,176
So what is slash search?

1741
01:14:31,316 --> 01:14:34,576
Well, it's not obvious here what
programming language Google uses

1742
01:14:34,576 --> 01:14:36,986
but if we were on Facebook, we
would probably see search.php

1743
01:14:36,986 --> 01:14:40,126
because Facebook is
known for using PHP.

1744
01:14:40,126 --> 01:14:42,526
They're also known for not
hiding their file extensions,

1745
01:14:42,526 --> 01:14:44,946
which is very easy to do but
they just don't for some reason.

1746
01:14:45,236 --> 01:14:47,726
Google does hide their
file extension but a lot

1747
01:14:47,726 --> 01:14:49,856
of Google's code, at least
front end is written apparently

1748
01:14:49,856 --> 01:14:52,376
in Python or in some
other languages.

1749
01:14:52,376 --> 01:14:55,016
So it's not clear what
language is on the server

1750
01:14:55,296 --> 01:14:58,546
but slash search is
referring to some file

1751
01:14:58,546 --> 01:15:00,286
or some folder on the server.

1752
01:15:00,556 --> 01:15:01,836
What does the question
mark denote?

1753
01:15:02,286 --> 01:15:05,746
What's that?

1754
01:15:05,936 --> 01:15:06,126
>> Start.

1755
01:15:06,456 --> 01:15:07,746
>> The start of the parameters.

1756
01:15:07,886 --> 01:15:10,436
So anytime you have a
question mark in the URL,

1757
01:15:10,436 --> 01:15:13,606
that demarks the path and
the preceding part of the URL

1758
01:15:13,886 --> 01:15:16,986
from all of the parameters and
parameters are key value pairs,

1759
01:15:16,986 --> 01:15:18,076
something equals something.

1760
01:15:18,326 --> 01:15:20,656
And if you have multiple
parameters, what separates them,

1761
01:15:20,936 --> 01:15:22,596
even though I already
deleted the others.

1762
01:15:22,656 --> 01:15:22,723
Yeah?

1763
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:23,206
>> And.

1764
01:15:24,536 --> 01:15:28,146
>> The and, the ampersand
symbol.

1765
01:15:28,346 --> 01:15:30,586
So if I hadn't deleted
all of that,

1766
01:15:30,816 --> 01:15:33,536
recall that we saw something
like this just a moment ago

1767
01:15:33,536 --> 01:15:35,746
and oq equals Harvard.

1768
01:15:35,746 --> 01:15:37,046
And I don't know what oq is

1769
01:15:37,046 --> 01:15:39,396
but that's how you would
separate parameters,

1770
01:15:39,396 --> 01:15:40,146
with ampersands.

1771
01:15:40,466 --> 01:15:45,386
So this means we have
submitted key of q and a value

1772
01:15:45,526 --> 01:15:46,646
of Harvard to the server.

1773
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:49,946
So now, let's use a fairly
common tool built into Chrome.

1774
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:51,326
It's also built into Safari.

1775
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:53,096
Firefox has something similar

1776
01:15:53,096 --> 01:15:54,846
when we recommend
something called Firebug

1777
01:15:54,846 --> 01:15:56,966
on the course's website
with which

1778
01:15:56,966 --> 01:15:58,106
to do the same kind of thing.

1779
01:15:58,416 --> 01:16:02,366
But I'm going to go to View,
Developer, and Developer Tools.

1780
01:16:02,366 --> 01:16:05,126
And I will say these days
certainly when using LAMP,

1781
01:16:05,326 --> 01:16:09,286
Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP,
which is this course's focus,

1782
01:16:09,586 --> 01:16:12,366
many people are increasingly
using Chrome, one,

1783
01:16:12,366 --> 01:16:14,496
because it's popular, two,
because it's fast, three,

1784
01:16:14,496 --> 01:16:16,166
because it comes with
some developer tools.

1785
01:16:16,506 --> 01:16:19,306
I would say Firefox is
also wonderfully convenient

1786
01:16:19,306 --> 01:16:21,296
for doing development and
you should certainly test

1787
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:24,596
on multiple browsers as
we'll require in one of the--

1788
01:16:24,596 --> 01:16:27,586
in the first project
spec. You can do Window--

1789
01:16:27,586 --> 01:16:29,286
rather Internet Explorer
is getting better

1790
01:16:29,286 --> 01:16:31,106
about having some
integrated development tools.

1791
01:16:31,106 --> 01:16:33,766
From the courses perspective, we
don't care about browser you use

1792
01:16:33,766 --> 01:16:36,106
because you'll be using again
the appliance as a server.

1793
01:16:36,326 --> 01:16:38,426
You can use whatever browser,
whatever operating system

1794
01:16:38,426 --> 01:16:40,786
on your own computer that
you're most comfortable with.

1795
01:16:40,876 --> 01:16:44,866
But if you are coming
to this with some,

1796
01:16:45,116 --> 01:16:49,686
I'd say less familiarity
with various tools,

1797
01:16:49,966 --> 01:16:52,286
Chrome is pretty popular
and Firefox tend to be,

1798
01:16:52,286 --> 01:16:54,516
I think better for development
purposes even though you should

1799
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:55,546
test on all of them.

1800
01:16:55,876 --> 01:16:56,856
So what am I seeing here?

1801
01:16:56,856 --> 01:17:00,706
I've just opened the developer
tabs, and now I have elements,

1802
01:17:00,786 --> 01:17:02,646
resources, networks,
scripts, timeline,

1803
01:17:02,646 --> 01:17:03,946
profiles, audits and console.

1804
01:17:03,946 --> 01:17:05,336
We're not going to use
all of these but a few

1805
01:17:05,336 --> 01:17:06,666
of them are quite helpful, one,

1806
01:17:06,986 --> 01:17:09,506
the elements tab shows
you the pages HTML

1807
01:17:09,736 --> 01:17:12,266
but it pretty-prints it for you
and it makes it hierarchical

1808
01:17:12,266 --> 01:17:14,456
so that with those little
triangles, you can dive

1809
01:17:14,456 --> 01:17:17,726
in deeper and see even though
if we look at view source

1810
01:17:17,726 --> 01:17:20,906
for the page, it is an
utter mess of a page.

1811
01:17:20,906 --> 01:17:26,206
If I go over here
and view page source,

1812
01:17:26,656 --> 01:17:28,076
this is what came
back from the server.

1813
01:17:28,746 --> 01:17:31,786
And I would argue this is
not very readable to a human,

1814
01:17:33,006 --> 01:17:35,146
even when we get
to the actual HTML,

1815
01:17:35,566 --> 01:17:37,406
even the HTML not that readable.

1816
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:39,406
Color coded maybe,
still not useful.

1817
01:17:39,686 --> 01:17:40,546
So what does this do?

1818
01:17:40,686 --> 01:17:43,356
It actually-- The developer
toolbar actually parses it

1819
01:17:43,356 --> 01:17:44,736
for you so you can
start to navigate.

1820
01:17:44,836 --> 01:17:47,026
And this is actually wonderfully
compelling whether it's your

1821
01:17:47,026 --> 01:17:48,046
site or someone else is.

1822
01:17:48,046 --> 01:17:49,896
If it's someone else
is, it's a wonderful way

1823
01:17:49,896 --> 01:17:51,466
of learning how they
did something

1824
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:52,786
or how they stylize something.

1825
01:17:52,786 --> 01:17:53,506
If it's your own site,

1826
01:17:53,686 --> 01:17:55,376
it's a wonderful way
of chasing down bugs.

1827
01:17:55,626 --> 01:17:58,816
And also as you'll see,
changing on the fly some

1828
01:17:58,816 --> 01:18:01,696
of the aesthetics without
having to change actual files

1829
01:18:01,696 --> 01:18:03,426
and then reload or re-upload.

1830
01:18:03,736 --> 01:18:05,936
So, we don't care so much
about elements right now

1831
01:18:06,066 --> 01:18:07,316
but we do care about network.

1832
01:18:07,526 --> 01:18:09,246
So let me go to the network tab.

1833
01:18:09,466 --> 01:18:14,546
And what this tab will
do for us is sniff all

1834
01:18:14,546 --> 01:18:17,406
of the network traffic between
my browser and the server

1835
01:18:17,496 --> 01:18:20,066
and it will show each
HTTP request one per line

1836
01:18:20,066 --> 01:18:20,516
at the bottom.

1837
01:18:20,516 --> 01:18:22,076
So I'm going to leave
this window open,

1838
01:18:22,076 --> 01:18:23,146
I'm going to click reload.

1839
01:18:23,146 --> 01:18:25,106
And again, this is my URL.

1840
01:18:26,296 --> 01:18:28,126
And here we go.

1841
01:18:28,356 --> 01:18:28,956
That's a lot.

1842
01:18:29,186 --> 01:18:31,156
I only hit reload once
but why in the world

1843
01:18:31,156 --> 01:18:33,366
that so many rows
appear down here?

1844
01:18:38,196 --> 01:18:41,246
I clicked once, but look how
much stuff just happened.

1845
01:18:41,476 --> 01:18:45,566
Why? Each of those again
represents an HTTP request.

1846
01:18:45,706 --> 01:18:48,426
So a virtual envelope from
browser to server and back.

1847
01:18:48,526 --> 01:18:48,636
Yeah?

1848
01:18:48,776 --> 01:18:50,516
>> Well there's a lot
going on behind the scenes.

1849
01:18:50,516 --> 01:18:51,756
>> What does that mean,
behind the scenes?

1850
01:18:51,966 --> 01:18:55,206
>> Well, Google doesn't just
have one method for [inaudible].

1851
01:18:55,386 --> 01:18:58,966
There's things that it has to
call, other things that it has

1852
01:18:58,966 --> 01:19:02,036
to find and bring up and so
that's all coming up in this--

1853
01:19:02,526 --> 01:19:03,226
>> OK, good.

1854
01:19:03,226 --> 01:19:04,656
So Google needs to
pull up other things.

1855
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:07,016
Give me a concrete example of
something it has to pull up.

1856
01:19:07,016 --> 01:19:07,396
>> Like an image.

1857
01:19:07,646 --> 01:19:12,156
>> Good. So inside of the HTML
that's initially downloaded,

1858
01:19:12,156 --> 01:19:15,176
there could be an image tag, a
source tag, a link tag to CSS,

1859
01:19:15,176 --> 01:19:17,906
to JavaScript, to images,
it could be flash files,

1860
01:19:17,996 --> 01:19:20,216
it could be a whole bunch of
other assets, so to speak.

1861
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:23,096
And to get those, the
browser is predefined to sort

1862
01:19:23,296 --> 01:19:25,136
of recursively go
get those assets.

1863
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:27,506
So if it sees a source
tag or an image tag,

1864
01:19:27,686 --> 01:19:30,016
it will send another
virtual envelop requesting

1865
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,336
that file specifically.

1866
01:19:31,556 --> 01:19:33,426
It might do it over the
same network connection,

1867
01:19:33,426 --> 01:19:35,236
the same TCP socket,
so to speak,

1868
01:19:35,446 --> 01:19:37,716
but each of these rows
represents a different file

1869
01:19:37,796 --> 01:19:38,596
that was downloaded.

1870
01:19:38,876 --> 01:19:42,256
Ironically, it seems that
Harvard is not behaving well

1871
01:19:42,256 --> 01:19:44,296
in the terms of the auto
previews but that's good.

1872
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:45,596
In another day we
can look at why.

1873
01:19:46,056 --> 01:19:47,436
But let's look at the first one

1874
01:19:47,436 --> 01:19:49,206
because that's the one that'll
be the most enlightening

1875
01:19:49,206 --> 01:19:49,726
for now.

1876
01:19:50,066 --> 01:19:52,946
And when I click on this,
there's a few detail.

1877
01:19:52,946 --> 01:19:55,346
So, one, the preview is
just what was returned.

1878
01:19:55,516 --> 01:19:58,806
And here is another big mess
of results from the web server.

1879
01:19:58,806 --> 01:20:00,336
But we don't care
so much about that.

1880
01:20:00,336 --> 01:20:01,766
I care about the headers.

1881
01:20:02,046 --> 01:20:04,116
So let me zoom in on this.

1882
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,866
And rather than look at this
fairly pretty-printed version

1883
01:20:06,866 --> 01:20:08,586
of it, I want to look
at the raw source.

1884
01:20:08,586 --> 01:20:11,526
So, we're diving in deep
sort of intellectually here

1885
01:20:11,526 --> 01:20:13,066
so let me look at view source.

1886
01:20:13,366 --> 01:20:17,926
Now this is what was literally
sent in that virtual envelope

1887
01:20:18,596 --> 01:20:20,656
that we started tonight's
discussion with.

1888
01:20:20,936 --> 01:20:22,576
So, there's the top line,

1889
01:20:22,576 --> 01:20:27,116
GET/search?q=harvard
HTTP/version number,

1890
01:20:27,116 --> 01:20:28,106
so that was in the envelope.

1891
01:20:28,426 --> 01:20:30,326
And we did promise there's
some other stuff in there.

1892
01:20:30,686 --> 01:20:32,956
Second line is a
reminder to the server

1893
01:20:33,146 --> 01:20:35,106
as to what the user typed in.

1894
01:20:35,106 --> 01:20:36,096
So what is the host name.

1895
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:38,146
Now frankly Google is
not sharing their servers

1896
01:20:38,146 --> 01:20:39,486
with other companies most likely

1897
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:41,186
so this doesn't really
matter there.

1898
01:20:41,416 --> 01:20:43,036
But for shared web
posting companies,

1899
01:20:43,086 --> 01:20:46,916
the fact that I'm being reminded
what the URL was means I can

1900
01:20:46,916 --> 01:20:49,606
serve up foo.com or
bar.com or bus.com,

1901
01:20:49,606 --> 01:20:51,466
so thankfully HTTP does that.

1902
01:20:51,886 --> 01:20:55,336
There's some arcane information
here related to caching

1903
01:20:55,336 --> 01:20:56,956
and connections and efficiency.

1904
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,236
Well let me wave my
hand at that for now.

1905
01:20:59,236 --> 01:21:02,166
User-Agent is interesting and
you might know this already

1906
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:05,866
but if you don't, every webpage
you've ever visited has--

1907
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:08,976
every website you've ever
visited knows what computer you

1908
01:21:08,976 --> 01:21:10,906
have and what operating
system you're running

1909
01:21:10,906 --> 01:21:12,496
and what browser you were using.

1910
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:13,346
Why is that?

1911
01:21:13,346 --> 01:21:16,746
Well browsers by default reveal
precisely that information.

1912
01:21:16,796 --> 01:21:19,006
I have just told
Google, behind the scenes

1913
01:21:19,006 --> 01:21:24,326
that I have a Mac running Mac
OS X 10.7.4 and if I scroll

1914
01:21:24,326 --> 01:21:26,196
down further, they
will be able to infer

1915
01:21:26,196 --> 01:21:28,526
that I was using Chrome
version something or rather.

1916
01:21:29,076 --> 01:21:32,096
So why in the world
is that useful?

1917
01:21:32,306 --> 01:21:32,386
Yeah?

1918
01:21:33,516 --> 01:21:42,556
[ Inaudible Remark ]

1919
01:21:43,056 --> 01:21:46,346
Good. So, arguably, this is
useful for debugging purposes,

1920
01:21:46,346 --> 01:21:49,596
useful for demographic purposes
to know who your users are.

1921
01:21:51,516 --> 01:21:55,616
[ Inaudible Remark ]

1922
01:21:56,116 --> 01:22:00,306
Good. So there are some
features that could be dictated

1923
01:22:00,306 --> 01:22:02,756
by what type of OS or
browser someone is using.

1924
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:04,076
For instance, if
you go to a website

1925
01:22:04,076 --> 01:22:06,956
that lets you download software,
you know, it's not necessary

1926
01:22:06,956 --> 01:22:09,416
that you detect what the user's
operating system and browser are

1927
01:22:09,506 --> 01:22:11,186
but it's kind of a
nicer user experience

1928
01:22:11,266 --> 01:22:14,126
if the server only shows
you the Mac software

1929
01:22:14,366 --> 01:22:16,516
because you clearly have a
Mac as opposed to me having

1930
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:17,866
to figure out which
of the links to click

1931
01:22:17,906 --> 01:22:20,736
for Linux or Windows or Mac OS.

1932
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:23,416
Another argument frankly is that
this is completely unnecessary

1933
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:24,236
and we should never have gotten

1934
01:22:24,236 --> 01:22:25,346
to this habit in
the first place.

1935
01:22:25,476 --> 01:22:28,896
Because if for-- it's not
necessarily used all that much.

1936
01:22:29,206 --> 01:22:31,046
And indeed, writing websites

1937
01:22:31,186 --> 01:22:34,556
that require knowing what
the user's browser is,

1938
01:22:34,556 --> 01:22:36,216
is actually generally
bad practice

1939
01:22:36,356 --> 01:22:38,206
because there will be
certain privacy tools

1940
01:22:38,516 --> 01:22:39,896
that users can install
in their computer

1941
01:22:39,896 --> 01:22:41,946
that just hide this
information altogether

1942
01:22:42,146 --> 01:22:43,136
for better or for worse.

1943
01:22:43,136 --> 01:22:45,536
And if you're relying on
certain headers to be sent,

1944
01:22:45,776 --> 01:22:47,396
your own website
could misbehave.

1945
01:22:47,736 --> 01:22:49,426
So there are-- it turns
out there's other tricks

1946
01:22:49,426 --> 01:22:51,776
for doing detection and
typically as we'll see

1947
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,466
in JavaScript, it's
better generally

1948
01:22:53,466 --> 01:22:56,986
to detect whether a browser
has a certain feature rather

1949
01:22:56,986 --> 01:22:59,206
than is it a specific
operating system

1950
01:22:59,206 --> 01:23:00,856
or a specific version
of a browser.

1951
01:23:01,026 --> 01:23:03,996
However, databases freely
available exist that allow you

1952
01:23:03,996 --> 01:23:07,726
to figure out based on the
so called user agent strings,

1953
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,996
what version of browser

1954
01:23:10,996 --> 01:23:12,116
and operating system
someone's using.

1955
01:23:12,116 --> 01:23:13,666
Because frankly this is
a little hard to read,

1956
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:15,766
so software exist
that simplifies this.

1957
01:23:15,766 --> 01:23:18,816
So you can just check a boolean
variable is Mac or in PC.

1958
01:23:18,996 --> 01:23:20,276
All right, what's below?

1959
01:23:20,566 --> 01:23:22,776
Some more arcane details
that I'll wave my hand at.

1960
01:23:23,036 --> 01:23:24,946
Cookies we'll come back
to in a week or two

1961
01:23:24,946 --> 01:23:26,856
when we actually start
using them to our advantage

1962
01:23:26,856 --> 01:23:29,206
but we'll also talk about the
security implications of them.

1963
01:23:29,486 --> 01:23:31,456
But in a nutshell,
all of these headers,

1964
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:35,146
just text is what was inside
of that virtual envelope.

1965
01:23:35,146 --> 01:23:37,606
And the most important one
arguably was the very first one

1966
01:23:37,606 --> 01:23:39,076
because that tells
Google what to return.

1967
01:23:39,426 --> 01:23:42,476
But now we see that it's not
just slash, it's a full path.

1968
01:23:43,016 --> 01:23:47,266
So Google has hopefully parsed
that string, so to speak, slash,

1969
01:23:47,266 --> 01:23:49,186
search, question mark,
q equals Harvard,

1970
01:23:49,416 --> 01:23:53,216
and then use the q equals
Harvard as input to its database

1971
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,196
or whatnot to return
customized results to me.

1972
01:23:56,726 --> 01:23:59,026
Now if we scroll down, let's
see how Google replied.

1973
01:23:59,656 --> 01:24:01,446
So this is just a Chrome thing.

1974
01:24:01,696 --> 01:24:03,476
It is just kind of
dumbed down display

1975
01:24:03,476 --> 01:24:05,326
of the query string
parameter, so it's just useful.

1976
01:24:05,326 --> 01:24:07,366
Especially for a developer you
can just see it more easily

1977
01:24:07,366 --> 01:24:07,806
this way.

1978
01:24:08,196 --> 01:24:10,786
But let me go ahead and view
source now for response headers.

1979
01:24:11,116 --> 01:24:12,876
This is what the
server responded with.

1980
01:24:13,286 --> 01:24:17,876
So it turns out many of you have
seen numbers return by server.

1981
01:24:17,876 --> 01:24:20,236
Who has ever seen the
message 404 come back?

1982
01:24:20,886 --> 01:24:21,916

>> 301 and 302 are redirects
which are actually quite useful

1996
01:24:54,616 --> 01:24:57,066
and we'll start using those
in the next lecture or two.

1997
01:24:57,206 --> 01:24:59,196
So in short, there's some codes
that you've probably seen.

1998
01:24:59,196 --> 01:25:00,636
404 is maybe the most popular.

1999
01:25:00,866 --> 01:25:03,256
200 you might not have ever
seen, but this is the best one

2000
01:25:03,256 --> 01:25:07,346
of all, 200 is literally OK, it
means everything worked out well

2001
01:25:07,346 --> 01:25:09,826
so you just don't see it
because it indicates success

2002
01:25:09,826 --> 01:25:11,336
as this little green icon

2003
01:25:11,336 --> 01:25:14,096
that we saw a moment ago
before I expanded this.

2004
01:25:14,456 --> 01:25:16,546
So, this is the server's
response, 200 means,

2005
01:25:16,676 --> 01:25:18,196
found what you're
looking for, here it is.

2006
01:25:18,556 --> 01:25:19,726
Now, what else comes down?

2007
01:25:20,236 --> 01:25:24,686
We have the date from the server
which might be useful, expires

2008
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:27,686
and cache control, so directives
to the browser saying, doer,

2009
01:25:27,686 --> 01:25:29,866
don't cache this, even though
these are not necessarily

2010
01:25:29,866 --> 01:25:31,986
reliable, but we'll talk
about this when we get

2011
01:25:31,986 --> 01:25:33,806
to PHP, this is interesting.

2012
01:25:33,876 --> 01:25:37,156
Set-Cookie, Set-Cookie is
amazingly powerful, if not,

2013
01:25:37,156 --> 01:25:39,536
a little unsettling especially
in the world of advertising

2014
01:25:39,536 --> 01:25:40,906
and tracking, but
we'll talk about that

2015
01:25:40,906 --> 01:25:42,496
in the context of PHP.

2016
01:25:42,496 --> 01:25:45,056
Notice that the server is
telling us that it supports gzip

2017
01:25:45,316 --> 01:25:47,326
which is like a compression
utility,

2018
01:25:47,626 --> 01:25:50,046
which is a compression utility
and this just means, hey,

2019
01:25:50,176 --> 01:25:53,806
you can compress your
data to and from me.

2020
01:25:53,806 --> 01:25:57,556
The name of the server, gws,
probably Google web services

2021
01:25:57,716 --> 01:25:59,366
and then some headers
that they use for some

2022
01:25:59,366 --> 01:26:00,526
of the security things
we'll talk

2023
01:26:00,526 --> 01:26:02,066
about later in the semester.

2024
01:26:02,066 --> 01:26:04,466
So that's what Google
has returned in addition

2025
01:26:04,466 --> 01:26:07,256
to the content that has
come back from the server.

2026
01:26:07,596 --> 01:26:09,786
So let's see this outside
the scope of our browser.

2027
01:26:09,786 --> 01:26:13,146
I'm going to go on and open
a program called Terminal

2028
01:26:13,746 --> 01:26:15,676
which comes with Mac
OS, for those of you

2029
01:26:15,676 --> 01:26:18,326
with Windows PuTTY is another
option and we'll look at that

2030
01:26:18,776 --> 01:26:21,816
or encourage that in-- my
music is still playing.

2031
01:26:22,366 --> 01:26:24,986
We'll look at that,
we'll recommend

2032
01:26:24,986 --> 01:26:26,376
that for future project
and I'm going

2033
01:26:26,376 --> 01:26:27,576
to run a program called telnet,

2034
01:26:27,686 --> 01:26:29,936
telnet is like SSH
but unencrypted.

2035
01:26:29,936 --> 01:26:31,606
You know, that's bit of
an over simplification.

2036
01:26:31,876 --> 01:26:34,166
I'm going to go head
and telnet to google.com

2037
01:26:34,546 --> 01:26:36,316
and nothing actually happens.

2038
01:26:36,426 --> 01:26:38,136
But it did figure out
Google's IP address,

2039
01:26:38,246 --> 01:26:39,276
so that's interesting.

2040
01:26:39,726 --> 01:26:46,036
But telnet by default uses port
20-- it's been so long, 21,

2041
01:26:46,486 --> 01:26:49,136
tenet uses port 21, TCP port 21

2042
01:26:49,516 --> 01:26:52,316
but there's no telnet server
there, telnet use to be

2043
01:26:52,316 --> 01:26:54,706
to send messages and connect
to email serves and the like.

2044
01:26:54,706 --> 01:26:57,626
But what if I instead say
80, so there's no colon

2045
01:26:57,626 --> 01:26:59,206
in this program, there
is in the browser.

2046
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:01,356
But this is going to
connect from my laptop

2047
01:27:01,356 --> 01:27:03,266
to google.com on TCP port 80.

2048
01:27:03,396 --> 01:27:05,156
So this is interesting.

2049
01:27:05,466 --> 01:27:08,076
Now, I've connected
to their server, why?

2050
01:27:08,226 --> 01:27:09,206
Or how do I know that?

2051
01:27:09,286 --> 01:27:12,726
It's telling me, connected
to www.l.google.com.

2052
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:14,146
Where did this l come from?

2053
01:27:14,366 --> 01:27:16,036
They're doing some DNS
trickery, it's probably

2054
01:27:16,036 --> 01:27:18,466
for load balancing purposes,
they have multiple servers,

2055
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:20,606
so therefore, I've gotten
one of them, specifically.

2056
01:27:20,606 --> 01:27:22,336
But I'm going to
pretend to be a browser.

2057
01:27:22,336 --> 01:27:26,036
I'm going to say, get me
slash using HTTP version 1.1

2058
01:27:26,266 --> 01:27:27,266
and then hit enter.

2059
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:29,116
And then if that's the
last of my headers,

2060
01:27:29,116 --> 01:27:32,886
I have to hit enter twice,
and viola, what do I see?

2061
01:27:33,226 --> 01:27:36,036
Well the font is kind of big
and HTML and Java Script is kind

2062
01:27:36,036 --> 01:27:39,136
of minified but that's exactly
what my browser got back.

2063
01:27:39,136 --> 01:27:41,176
But if I keep going up
and up and up and up,

2064
01:27:41,486 --> 01:27:45,486
notice I can see exactly what
the server's response was.

2065
01:27:45,896 --> 01:27:48,566
So I see my HTTP headers that
came back from the server,

2066
01:27:49,146 --> 01:27:50,856
Set-Cookie and all
those same lines,

2067
01:27:50,856 --> 01:27:52,306
exactly what I saw
on the browser.

2068
01:27:52,306 --> 01:27:54,796
So I've just pretended
really to be a browser.

2069
01:27:54,796 --> 01:27:57,126
And we can do this with
any websites and it's more

2070
01:27:57,126 --> 01:27:59,696
than just a curiosity, it can
actually help with debugging

2071
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:01,986
or actually seeing what's
coming back from a server.

2072
01:28:02,266 --> 01:28:08,806
I can do www.harvard.edu 80.

2073
01:28:08,806 --> 01:28:11,236
GET/HTTP 1.1, enter, enter.

2074
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:13,036
So, interesting.

2075
01:28:13,036 --> 01:28:13,696
Bad request.

2076
01:28:14,716 --> 01:28:15,476
Now why is that?

2077
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:17,516
So we see some HTML,
because this--

2078
01:28:17,516 --> 01:28:18,656
the web server assumes

2079
01:28:18,656 --> 01:28:20,246
that a browser will
typically be doing this.

2080
01:28:20,876 --> 01:28:22,396
Why might this be a bad request?

2081
01:28:23,156 --> 01:28:27,576
I'm actually going
to guess here.

2082
01:28:27,576 --> 01:28:33,196
Let's try this, GET/HTTP
1.1, Host harvard.edu.

2083
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:34,186
There we go.

2084
01:28:34,566 --> 01:28:38,466
So it didn't like the fact that
I did not send the host header

2085
01:28:38,726 --> 01:28:41,576
which means Harvard's web server
is probably using something

2086
01:28:41,576 --> 01:28:44,426
called virtual hosting, which
is that feature I alluded

2087
01:28:44,426 --> 01:28:47,136
to earlier when a
website can support--

2088
01:28:47,246 --> 01:28:50,476
when a web server can support
multiple websites but for

2089
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:53,086
that to work, browsers
have to cooperate.

2090
01:28:53,376 --> 01:28:55,516
And the fact that I did
not send that header meant

2091
01:28:55,516 --> 01:28:57,456
that the server didn't know
who's home page to return

2092
01:28:57,726 --> 01:29:00,806
so it gave me that 400 response
of I don't know what to do.

2093
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:03,096
Now let's try one other
thing, let me cancel this

2094
01:29:04,006 --> 01:29:08,366
and let me do, telnet
to not www.harvard.edu,

2095
01:29:08,366 --> 01:29:09,976
let's try this one,
just see what happens.

2096
01:29:10,446 --> 01:29:14,116
So GET/HTTP 1.1, enter, enter.

2097
01:29:14,116 --> 01:29:15,466
OK. It didn't like that.

2098
01:29:15,466 --> 01:29:16,496
So let's fix this again.

2099
01:29:16,996 --> 01:29:24,286
So, GET/HTTP 1.1, Host
harvard.edu, enter, enter.

2100
01:29:25,036 --> 01:29:25,536
Interesting.

2101
01:29:25,816 --> 01:29:26,816
This is not the home page?

2102
01:29:26,816 --> 01:29:29,806
What did I get this time?

2103
01:29:29,966 --> 01:29:31,926
Some message about it's moved,

2104
01:29:32,366 --> 01:29:34,616
harvard.edu has moved
permanently no less.

2105
01:29:34,806 --> 01:29:37,566
And if I scroll up,
more esoterically

2106
01:29:37,566 --> 01:29:39,716
in the headers is one,
a different status code,

2107
01:29:39,716 --> 01:29:43,336
301 which we mentioned earlier,
301 means permanent redirect.

2108
01:29:43,696 --> 01:29:45,436
If a browser receives a 301,

2109
01:29:45,956 --> 01:29:47,776
it should never ask
that question again.

2110
01:29:48,076 --> 01:29:50,636
It should just remember
harvard.edu moved,

2111
01:29:50,826 --> 01:29:51,836
and it moved where?

2112
01:29:52,006 --> 01:29:53,706
To the value of the
location field

2113
01:29:53,706 --> 01:29:56,096
which should also be included
in the response headers.

2114
01:29:56,096 --> 01:29:56,906
How did that happened?

2115
01:29:57,646 --> 01:29:59,786
Well some system
administrator or a dean

2116
01:29:59,786 --> 01:30:02,396
at Harvard just decided
arbitrarily that's--

2117
01:30:02,466 --> 01:30:04,676
but reasonably, that we
don't want to standardize

2118
01:30:04,676 --> 01:30:07,426
on harvard.edu in our
browsers and people's browsers.

2119
01:30:07,426 --> 01:30:12,636
We want them automatically to be
redirected to www.hardvard.edu.

2120
01:30:12,676 --> 01:30:15,916
Why? One, branding, I
mean, that's one reason,

2121
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,336
which is perfectly reasonable.

2122
01:30:17,616 --> 01:30:20,146
Two, more technologically,
it can be better for,

2123
01:30:20,766 --> 01:30:22,336
security is a bit
of an overstatement,

2124
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,726
but for technical reasons,

2125
01:30:23,726 --> 01:30:26,796
having the www means your
cookies can be isolated

2126
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:31,816
to www.harvard.edu, whereas, if
your cookies were instead sent

2127
01:30:31,816 --> 01:30:34,946
to hardvard.edu, that means your
cookies could be read really

2128
01:30:34,946 --> 01:30:38,656
by any websites, so
including cs.harvard.edu

2129
01:30:38,656 --> 01:30:41,016
or summer.harvard.edu.

2130
01:30:41,276 --> 01:30:44,496
So by saying www, you're
also forcing at least

2131
01:30:44,496 --> 01:30:46,996
by default cookies to be
more precisely defined.

2132
01:30:46,996 --> 01:30:48,486
So there are some
technical reasons as well.

2133
01:30:48,796 --> 01:30:51,706
Only a year or two was
this problem fixed, they--

2134
01:30:51,706 --> 01:30:54,546
few years back, someone
new came to Harvard

2135
01:30:54,546 --> 01:30:56,426
to run the news office and
one of her first things,

2136
01:30:56,866 --> 01:31:00,316
one of her first acts was to fix
a horrific omission for years

2137
01:31:00,316 --> 01:31:01,836
where harvard.edu did not exist.

2138
01:31:02,316 --> 01:31:06,226
www.hardvard.edu existed and
they weren't even redirecting.

2139
01:31:06,276 --> 01:31:08,866
So, that is a bug
that's now been solved.

2140
01:31:09,486 --> 01:31:14,116
Any questions then on
what just happened there?

2141
01:31:14,116 --> 01:31:16,166
You all have the terminal
window open, let me offer

2142
01:31:16,166 --> 01:31:18,056
up some other troubleshooting
tips.

2143
01:31:18,186 --> 01:31:21,066
NS look up, name server
look up is a wonderful way

2144
01:31:21,236 --> 01:31:24,096
of doing those DNS look
ups we talked about before.

2145
01:31:24,336 --> 01:31:27,756
What I've just done is ask the
nearest DNS server which happens

2146
01:31:27,806 --> 01:31:30,056
to be this because that's how
Harvard has configured the

2147
01:31:30,056 --> 01:31:31,516
campus, that's the DNS server.

2148
01:31:31,896 --> 01:31:34,506
And I've asked what the
IP address of hardvard.edu

2149
01:31:34,586 --> 01:31:35,996
and it's given me
this IP address.

2150
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:39,616
So if I want to get
curious, let me do this,

2151
01:31:39,616 --> 01:31:43,006
http://ipaddress, interesting.

2152
01:31:43,986 --> 01:31:45,376
Why this is not working?

2153
01:31:45,376 --> 01:31:46,516
Well, again, VHosting.

2154
01:31:46,696 --> 01:31:48,356
Like the website
is not configured

2155
01:31:48,356 --> 01:31:50,626
to understand IP
addresses by default.

2156
01:31:50,806 --> 01:31:51,906
However, let's try another one.

2157
01:31:51,976 --> 01:31:57,876
NS look up cnn.com-- oops,
cnn.com, well interesting.

2158
01:31:58,006 --> 01:31:59,326
So it turns out with DNS,

2159
01:31:59,326 --> 01:32:01,086
you can also do what's
called round robin.

2160
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:04,126
You can return multiple IP
addresses for a web server

2161
01:32:04,126 --> 01:32:06,166
and those can rotate
literally in the order

2162
01:32:06,166 --> 01:32:08,996
in which they're returned to do
load balancing and we'll discuss

2163
01:32:09,026 --> 01:32:11,386
that topic again toward the end
of the semester in scalability.

2164
01:32:11,386 --> 01:32:12,366
But let me choose one of these.

2165
01:32:12,366 --> 01:32:14,166
And CNN either pretty big.

2166
01:32:14,166 --> 01:32:16,536
I am guessing they don't
really share with some other

2167
01:32:16,536 --> 01:32:17,276
with some other websites.

2168
01:32:17,466 --> 01:32:18,906
So let's just go
their IP address

2169
01:32:19,346 --> 01:32:20,906
and indeed, there it works.

2170
01:32:21,336 --> 01:32:23,416
And now notice my
URL hasn't changed.

2171
01:32:23,646 --> 01:32:27,586
So now, if I really
want to get sort of--

2172
01:32:27,716 --> 01:32:33,216
if I really want to get sort of
creative, I'm going to do this.

2173
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:36,176
On my Mac and you can do this
on a Windows machine as well.

2174
01:32:36,496 --> 01:32:39,156
There's typically a file on
Macs and Linux computers,

2175
01:32:39,156 --> 01:32:41,936
it' called etc host which
a text file that maps,

2176
01:32:42,226 --> 01:32:46,126
that hard codes IP
addresses for domain names.

2177
01:32:46,486 --> 01:32:49,376
This is useful generally
for internal corporate use

2178
01:32:49,376 --> 01:32:50,736
or development purposes.

2179
01:32:50,736 --> 01:32:52,986
So we'll be able to do
this with projects as well.

2180
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:56,386
I'm going to go ahead
and authenticate here.

2181
01:32:57,026 --> 01:33:00,726
It's just a text file and
notice this is some basic ones

2182
01:33:00,726 --> 01:33:01,746
that come with the system.

2183
01:33:01,786 --> 01:33:04,996
This is an IPV 6, version 6
address written in a crazy from.

2184
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:08,416
I'm going to go ahead
and paste in not the URL

2185
01:33:08,676 --> 01:33:11,006
but the IP address
of CNN and I'm going

2186
01:33:11,006 --> 01:33:15,036
to say this is davidnews.com.

2187
01:33:15,396 --> 01:33:17,586
So this is like manually
overwriting,

2188
01:33:17,766 --> 01:33:20,516
the mapping of that IP
address to something else here,

2189
01:33:20,516 --> 01:33:21,696
only from my own computer.

2190
01:33:21,776 --> 01:33:23,036
I'm not running a DNS server.

2191
01:33:23,206 --> 01:33:25,716
It's just that my
Operating System Mac OS

2192
01:33:25,716 --> 01:33:27,656
and Windows is supposed
to look at a file

2193
01:33:27,656 --> 01:33:29,856
like this before
asking a DNS server.

2194
01:33:30,346 --> 01:33:32,276
So now let's see if this works.

2195
01:33:32,276 --> 01:33:34,226
It doesn't work with all
websites but let me go

2196
01:33:34,226 --> 01:33:38,966
to http://dividnews.com.

2197
01:33:41,896 --> 01:33:46,006
Come on. Oh, come on.

2198
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:47,706
There it is.

2199
01:33:48,476 --> 01:33:50,256
I've just made my own news site.

2200
01:33:51,096 --> 01:33:53,136
So, frankly, this is
kind of stupid of them.

2201
01:33:53,226 --> 01:33:55,586
Like, I was just joking with
some friend the other day

2202
01:33:55,586 --> 01:33:56,866
that you could kind
of have fun with this

2203
01:33:56,866 --> 01:33:58,546
and make fairly offensive
domain names

2204
01:33:58,546 --> 01:34:00,546
and they all lead
to CNN somehow.

2205
01:34:00,546 --> 01:34:01,306
And why is this?

2206
01:34:01,626 --> 01:34:04,226
So, this is trivial defects
frankly in a web server.

2207
01:34:04,226 --> 01:34:07,216
A web server could be configured
as you will be able to do

2208
01:34:07,216 --> 01:34:11,156
with features of Apache before
long of checking upon receive

2209
01:34:11,156 --> 01:34:12,576
of one of those virtual
envelopes,

2210
01:34:12,576 --> 01:34:14,146
what was in two field?

2211
01:34:14,426 --> 01:34:16,586
If the two field does
not match something

2212
01:34:16,586 --> 01:34:18,766
that we're happy with,
redirect the user.

2213
01:34:18,766 --> 01:34:21,486
How? You respond with
what status code?

2214
01:34:22,656 --> 01:34:26,086
301. So it is actually trivial
to fix this kind of thing.

2215
01:34:26,086 --> 01:34:28,616
That could still lead-- They
can't stop davidnews.com

2216
01:34:28,616 --> 01:34:31,916
from leading to cnn.com but
they can stop the browser

2217
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:35,256
from staying there or at least
by encouraging it with that 301

2218
01:34:35,256 --> 01:34:36,366
to redirect elsewhere.

2219
01:34:36,576 --> 01:34:39,766
And this redirection is super
common, not just for harvard.edu

2220
01:34:39,996 --> 01:34:41,336
but even the course's
own website.

2221
01:34:41,336 --> 01:34:46,636
If I go to http://cs75.net
and hit enter,

2222
01:34:46,946 --> 01:34:49,256
notice what the URL changes to.

2223
01:34:50,816 --> 01:34:52,706
A few things happened there.

2224
01:34:52,826 --> 01:34:54,026
So this is the course's website.

2225
01:34:54,026 --> 01:34:54,866
What are some the things

2226
01:34:54,866 --> 01:34:58,156
that got inserted
automatically it seems?

2227
01:34:58,856 --> 01:34:58,936
Yeah.

2228
01:34:59,836 --> 01:35:01,766
>> [Inaudible] secure version.

2229
01:35:01,766 --> 01:35:02,516
>> Indeed.

2230
01:35:02,516 --> 01:35:05,186
So, I didn't just go
to the www version.

2231
01:35:05,186 --> 01:35:07,166
I also went to the
secure version, why?

2232
01:35:07,536 --> 01:35:09,506
We've just gotten into the habit
and I personally have gotten

2233
01:35:09,506 --> 01:35:11,046
to the habit of using this it
as a result for everything.

2234
01:35:11,046 --> 01:35:12,416
It's relatively cheap to do.

2235
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:15,556
It's relatively trivial to turn
on and it's only getting cheaper

2236
01:35:15,556 --> 01:35:16,896
as CPUs are getting faster.

2237
01:35:16,896 --> 01:35:19,146
And some of you might
be familiar with--

2238
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:22,296
about a year and a half ago
a tool called Firesheep was

2239
01:35:22,296 --> 01:35:25,366
released which was a wonderfully
free proof of concept

2240
01:35:25,366 --> 01:35:27,656
of something called a
session hijacking attack.

2241
01:35:27,906 --> 01:35:29,476
Something we'll talk
about in a few weeks time

2242
01:35:29,476 --> 01:35:30,736
in the context of security.

2243
01:35:31,156 --> 01:35:33,326
Long story short, if you
are visiting a website

2244
01:35:33,546 --> 01:35:39,076
that uses http://, it is
fairly trivial for someone

2245
01:35:39,076 --> 01:35:41,586
in your nearby wireless
vicinity whether in this room,

2246
01:35:41,626 --> 01:35:45,906
at Starbucks, even in your home,
if you have adversarial siblings

2247
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:49,696
or roommates to login
to your Facebook account

2248
01:35:49,696 --> 01:35:51,656
or your Google account
or-- actually not Google,

2249
01:35:51,756 --> 01:35:53,196
Facebook account
or Twitter account

2250
01:35:53,386 --> 01:35:55,276
or any websites that's
not using https.

2251
01:35:55,276 --> 01:35:58,576
And that is because if
you're not using https,

2252
01:35:59,106 --> 01:36:00,956
nothing is encrypted and
you probably knew that.

2253
01:36:01,586 --> 01:36:03,766
But among the things that
aren't encrypted are things

2254
01:36:03,766 --> 01:36:04,436
called cookies.

2255
01:36:04,876 --> 01:36:08,246
So if you are just broadcasting
cookies and cookies it turns

2256
01:36:08,246 --> 01:36:10,806
out as we'll see in a week
or two are the mechanism via

2257
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:14,096
which users are remembered as
being logged in to websites.

2258
01:36:14,446 --> 01:36:16,796
If you're just sending that
cookie to a website again

2259
01:36:16,796 --> 01:36:19,206
and again to remind you, I'm
logged in, I'm logged in,

2260
01:36:19,206 --> 01:36:20,996
I'm logged in, that's
not encrypted.

2261
01:36:20,996 --> 01:36:23,326
Anyone in Starbucks
can sniff that cookie

2262
01:36:23,576 --> 01:36:26,026
and with the right technical
savvy, as you will soon have,

2263
01:36:26,296 --> 01:36:28,126
send it as their own
and now they're logged

2264
01:36:28,126 --> 01:36:28,966
in to whatever you were.

2265
01:36:28,966 --> 01:36:30,506
It doesn't mean they
know your password

2266
01:36:30,936 --> 01:36:34,106
but it does mean they can
hijack your current session

2267
01:36:34,106 --> 01:36:34,746
so to speak.

2268
01:36:35,076 --> 01:36:38,466
So I retracted Google because
Google about a year or two ago,

2269
01:36:38,466 --> 01:36:40,446
thanks to some of the
issues in china they had

2270
01:36:40,446 --> 01:36:41,856
with the hacking and whatnot.

2271
01:36:42,116 --> 01:36:44,206
They transitioned all
their services to https.

2272
01:36:44,206 --> 01:36:45,956
At least if you opt
into it Facebook,

2273
01:36:45,956 --> 01:36:47,366
also finally offers this.

2274
01:36:47,696 --> 01:36:48,836
But again, we'll
come back to this.

2275
01:36:48,876 --> 01:36:51,116
So, a few more weeks of
insecurity in your lives

2276
01:36:51,116 --> 01:36:53,346
if you don't mind but we'll
come back to this and talk

2277
01:36:53,346 --> 01:36:55,366
about how you can have
certain defenses up.

2278
01:36:55,366 --> 01:36:59,626
And then tragically, even
websites that redirect

2279
01:37:00,076 --> 01:37:02,506
from the unencrypted version

2280
01:37:02,506 --> 01:37:05,726
to the encrypted version might
still be vulnerable because many

2281
01:37:05,726 --> 01:37:08,026
of those websites will
first do a redirect

2282
01:37:08,356 --> 01:37:11,786
that sends your cookie in the
clear and then it realizes, "Oh.

2283
01:37:11,786 --> 01:37:12,816
This should be secure."

2284
01:37:13,056 --> 01:37:14,036
But by then it's too late.

2285
01:37:14,306 --> 01:37:16,506
So, even though banking
websites almost always use this.

2286
01:37:16,506 --> 01:37:18,876
There have been certain
banks to be known to be not

2287
01:37:18,876 --> 01:37:22,526
so technically savvy who
are still leaking cookies

2288
01:37:23,116 --> 01:37:25,286
for reasons that
we'll soon reveal.

2289
01:37:25,556 --> 01:37:29,136
So I inserted the www the https
and then the stupid main page,

2290
01:37:29,136 --> 01:37:31,186
which is a media wiki thing
which is the tool we used

2291
01:37:31,186 --> 01:37:32,056
for the course's website.

2292
01:37:32,056 --> 01:37:33,286
It's free wiki software

2293
01:37:33,526 --> 01:37:35,306
and that's not really
intellectually interesting,

2294
01:37:35,436 --> 01:37:37,216
just their own software thing.

2295
01:37:37,776 --> 01:37:38,246
All right.

2296
01:37:38,566 --> 01:37:40,246
Any questions on http?

2297
01:37:41,346 --> 01:37:42,876
Well delete davidnews.com.

2298
01:37:43,146 --> 01:37:45,786
And again, that wouldn't
work with all web sites.

2299
01:37:45,786 --> 01:37:47,996
And in fact, Harvard's
probably would not work for us.

2300
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:49,656
All right.

2301
01:37:49,976 --> 01:37:52,366
So we've teased apart
these http headers.

2302
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:54,966
They'll become an invaluable
resource when it comes time

2303
01:37:54,966 --> 01:37:57,236
to chase down bugs or
features in your own code.

2304
01:37:57,386 --> 01:37:59,186
Let me take another
quick look at something

2305
01:37:59,186 --> 01:38:03,386
within Chrome's developer
toolbar then we'll do one last

2306
01:38:03,576 --> 01:38:05,106
thing with regard
to Google and see

2307
01:38:05,106 --> 01:38:06,726
if we can implement
a little more

2308
01:38:06,726 --> 01:38:07,976
of our own version of Google.

2309
01:38:08,306 --> 01:38:12,926
So, let me go to the elements
tab and just as a proof

2310
01:38:12,926 --> 01:38:15,216
of concept here, Google's
website is a little complex

2311
01:38:15,216 --> 01:38:17,906
underneath the hood, but let
me go ahead and right click

2312
01:38:17,936 --> 01:38:21,296
on Harvard University and I'm
going to choose Inspect Element.

2313
01:38:21,936 --> 01:38:24,106
And Inspect Element is
nice because it's going

2314
01:38:24,106 --> 01:38:27,856
to jump me right to the part
of the html that relates

2315
01:38:27,856 --> 01:38:30,646
to that portion of the page
which is wonderfully useful

2316
01:38:30,646 --> 01:38:32,366
for diving in deeper
to a specific place.

2317
01:38:32,726 --> 01:38:36,656
So that is the A href that got
me that Harvard University link.

2318
01:38:36,936 --> 01:38:38,916
Now suppose, I'm
actually Google's designer

2319
01:38:38,916 --> 01:38:40,846
and we're not quite happy
with the shade of blue

2320
01:38:40,846 --> 01:38:43,226
or the font size or font
face and so I want to tinker

2321
01:38:43,226 --> 01:38:45,536
with the web site but frankly
I don't want to have to log

2322
01:38:45,536 --> 01:38:48,526
in to the server and change font
size then save the file then

2323
01:38:48,526 --> 01:38:50,966
reload the browser and go
through all these hoops.

2324
01:38:51,096 --> 01:38:55,246
I kind of like to do it
inline in the browser albeit

2325
01:38:55,246 --> 01:38:56,586
without saving any changes.

2326
01:38:56,906 --> 01:38:59,616
So notice here on the right, if
you've not used Chrome before,

2327
01:39:00,186 --> 01:39:01,986
that-- or the developer toolbar.

2328
01:39:02,226 --> 01:39:06,006
Notice on the right, you have
a summary of all the styles

2329
01:39:06,036 --> 01:39:09,306
that relate to that specific
element in the web page.

2330
01:39:09,586 --> 01:39:14,246
So from top to bottom,
here's the C in CSS,

2331
01:39:14,246 --> 01:39:15,566
cascading top to bottom.

2332
01:39:15,866 --> 01:39:18,186
Here are all of the rules
that apply to that element.

2333
01:39:18,266 --> 01:39:21,686
So, here there's apparently
somewhere in Google CSS

2334
01:39:21,686 --> 01:39:26,036
and apparently the file called
search on line six, an a link,

2335
01:39:26,036 --> 01:39:28,546
a .w class mentioned
and all of this

2336
01:39:28,826 --> 01:39:31,096
where they're specifying the
color of the link and the cursor

2337
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:32,386
that should be used over it.

2338
01:39:32,706 --> 01:39:33,926
So let me just try it for kicks.

2339
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:36,976
Let me go in here and
let me change this

2340
01:39:36,976 --> 01:39:41,296
to let's say completely
random like orange.

2341
01:39:41,716 --> 01:39:42,876
So notice what I've
done up there.

2342
01:39:42,946 --> 01:39:44,506
I've changed the
Google's link to orange

2343
01:39:44,506 --> 01:39:47,636
of course not permanently and
only for the links in the page

2344
01:39:47,636 --> 01:39:49,266
for which that CSS rule applies.

2345
01:39:49,576 --> 01:39:51,526
But the point here is that this
is just a wonderfully quick

2346
01:39:51,526 --> 01:39:53,926
and dirty way of experimenting
especially if you're quite eager

2347
01:39:54,076 --> 01:39:56,656
and you want to get like
the pixel alignment perfect

2348
01:39:56,656 --> 01:39:56,936
in something.

2349
01:39:57,146 --> 01:40:00,756
Being able to just tweak it ever
so slightly here and then figure

2350
01:40:00,756 --> 01:40:02,826
out what the values
are and then write them

2351
01:40:02,926 --> 01:40:04,696
in the actual file
on the server.

2352
01:40:04,696 --> 01:40:06,256
It's just wonderfully useful.

2353
01:40:06,896 --> 01:40:08,126
Also too, if you
are trying to figure

2354
01:40:08,126 --> 01:40:10,026
out what font a web site uses.

2355
01:40:10,346 --> 01:40:11,886
I can go to computed style

2356
01:40:11,886 --> 01:40:13,766
because this can be a little
overwhelming like, "My God.

2357
01:40:13,766 --> 01:40:15,886
There's so many rules
that apply to this element

2358
01:40:15,886 --> 01:40:17,446
because of the cascading
nature of CSS."

2359
01:40:17,446 --> 01:40:21,246
Let me just look at the computed
styles which is the summary

2360
01:40:21,246 --> 01:40:24,556
of the end result of all of the
styles that have been applied

2361
01:40:24,856 --> 01:40:30,606
and if look for font family,
it indeed this is apply--

2362
01:40:30,666 --> 01:40:32,966
this is Arial followed
by Sans Serif.

2363
01:40:33,276 --> 01:40:35,326
So I know what font
now Google is using.

2364
01:40:35,326 --> 01:40:37,246
So just a debugging trick
it you've not used it,

2365
01:40:37,536 --> 01:40:39,286
this and the Network
tab we'll end

2366
01:40:39,286 --> 01:40:41,326
up using quite a
bit most likely.

2367
01:40:41,806 --> 01:40:43,716
So now back to our
own version of Google.

2368
01:40:43,906 --> 01:40:47,676
Unfortunately, if I type in
Harvard and hit Google search,

2369
01:40:48,016 --> 01:40:50,586
it doesn't go anywhere
sort of-- it kind of did.

2370
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:51,446
Where did it end up?

2371
01:40:52,726 --> 01:40:53,996
The URL is almost the same.

2372
01:40:53,996 --> 01:40:56,576
It's a crazy looking URL
because its obviously a file

2373
01:40:56,576 --> 01:40:58,056
on my hard drive
not in the internet.

2374
01:40:58,346 --> 01:40:59,756
But what did change in the URL?

2375
01:40:59,856 --> 01:40:59,946
Yeah?

2376
01:41:00,016 --> 01:41:01,096
[ Inaudible Remark ]

2377
01:41:01,096 --> 01:41:04,646
Good. So the question
mark got appended

2378
01:41:04,916 --> 01:41:08,636
but no parameters got
sent so let me go ahead

2379
01:41:08,636 --> 01:41:10,896
and take a look at
my file again.

2380
01:41:10,896 --> 01:41:12,596
Oh well, no parameters were sent

2381
01:41:12,596 --> 01:41:14,006
because I didn't give
any of them names.

2382
01:41:14,006 --> 01:41:15,086
So let me go back and fix this.

2383
01:41:15,086 --> 01:41:17,106
Let me shrink the font so
we can see more at once

2384
01:41:17,686 --> 01:41:22,496
and let me do input name equals
q here and let me go back

2385
01:41:22,496 --> 01:41:24,776
over here and reload the page.

2386
01:41:25,226 --> 01:41:27,396
And now let me go
ahead and type Harvard

2387
01:41:27,396 --> 01:41:28,796
and now click Google search.

2388
01:41:29,136 --> 01:41:30,326
So now we have some progress.

2389
01:41:30,806 --> 01:41:31,896
So this is interesting.

2390
01:41:32,096 --> 01:41:35,376
Now unfortunately, Google.html
is not a web site nor is

2391
01:41:35,376 --> 01:41:36,016
it dynamic.

2392
01:41:36,016 --> 01:41:37,396
It's literally just
a static file

2393
01:41:37,396 --> 01:41:39,476
so you can send any parameters
you want it's just going

2394
01:41:39,476 --> 01:41:40,566
to ignore you every time.

2395
01:41:41,046 --> 01:41:42,986
But what if I kind
of cheat here?

2396
01:41:43,456 --> 01:41:45,976
I'm kind of in a hurry to
implement my own search engine.

2397
01:41:45,976 --> 01:41:48,626
I-- You know, I already
knocked off my own news site,

2398
01:41:48,976 --> 01:41:50,546
now I want to do my
own search engine.

2399
01:41:50,806 --> 01:41:52,316
Well I can actually do this,

2400
01:41:52,686 --> 01:41:55,696
form action should
actually go to,

2401
01:41:55,696 --> 01:42:00,416
let's say www.google.com/search
and I'm going

2402
01:42:00,416 --> 01:42:04,396
to say method equals get
in all lower case here,

2403
01:42:04,666 --> 01:42:07,266
slight inconsistency with
what we've seen before.

2404
01:42:07,486 --> 01:42:10,076
And now, let me go back
to this page, oops,

2405
01:42:11,306 --> 01:42:13,746
reload and now let
me type Harvard

2406
01:42:13,746 --> 01:42:16,756
and watch the URL
as I hit enter.

2407
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:19,646
Ah, now I have implemented my
own version of Google but how?

2408
01:42:20,196 --> 01:42:23,476
Right. All I did was I
constructed a form I specified a

2409
01:42:23,476 --> 01:42:25,826
method of gets an
action that happens

2410
01:42:25,826 --> 01:42:28,556
to be a point B elsewhere
but because of HTTP

2411
01:42:28,556 --> 01:42:30,506
and because the browser
knows how to handle forms,

2412
01:42:30,566 --> 01:42:34,006
it compiled all of the key value
pairs, in this case just one,

2413
01:42:34,006 --> 01:42:36,936
q equals something put
it in the URL and sent it

2414
01:42:37,156 --> 01:42:38,936
to that action attribute.

2415
01:42:39,056 --> 01:42:40,646
Sent it to that particular URL.

2416
01:42:40,866 --> 01:42:44,276
So now we have implemented
our own version of Google.

2417
01:42:44,386 --> 01:42:47,086
Now of course it would be nice
if it were our search results

2418
01:42:47,086 --> 01:42:49,376
and we weren't completely
cutting corners here but that's

2419
01:42:49,376 --> 01:42:52,786
where we'll need something like
PHP to do things server side.

2420
01:42:53,926 --> 01:42:55,326
Let me pause for just a moment.

2421
01:42:55,326 --> 01:42:56,706
Peter, do you want to
say hello to the class?

Yeah. Why don't you
come this way

more readily available?

2429
01:43:07,756 --> 01:43:09,586
>> Hello all.

2430
01:43:09,586 --> 01:43:11,616

working with all of you

2431
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:13,116
and I will see you on Wednesday.

So let me go back into here

2441
01:43:31,266 --> 01:43:33,626
and let's just call it query

name to give a parameter to.

me type in Harvard, enter.

OK. That's probably not
supported but maybe let's see.

OK. Let me reload,

So we started by talking about
Google and we keep talking

about Google but just
because it's so popular

2479

but the story applies to
really, any web site out there.

2480
01:45:00,186 --> 01:45:04,826
So, we talked about DNS and
the process of not only looking

2481
01:45:04,826 --> 01:45:07,616
up a web page's URL
or rather IP address

2482

but also getting
your own IP address

2483

and getting your own web server
and your own domain name.

bit about HTML forms

2485

which you might be familiar
already but some of the tools

2486
01:45:17,606 --> 01:45:19,456
with which you can get a
little more comfortable

2487
01:45:19,456 --> 01:45:22,096
with diagnosing things
and debugging things

2488
01:45:22,096 --> 01:45:24,306

01:45:27,956 --> 01:45:29,886
For that we've completely
out sourced through CNN

2492
01:45:29,886 --> 01:45:31,436
and Google today but one

2493
01:45:31,436 --> 01:45:33,726
of the first things we will do
this coming Wednesday is dive

2494
01:45:33,726 --> 01:45:36,776
in deeper to PHP and
things like get and post

2495
01:45:36,806 --> 01:45:38,496
and sessions and shopping carts.

2496
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:40,746
Some of the security
implications around them,

2497
01:45:40,746 --> 01:45:42,526
we'll dive into the
CS50 appliance

2498
01:45:42,566 --> 01:45:43,986
and this virtual
machine environments

2499
01:45:43,986 --> 01:45:46,106
with which you'll
get to play in terms

2500
01:45:46,106 --> 01:45:48,336
of Apache and PHP and MySQL.

2501
01:45:48,906 --> 01:45:50,926
So tonight, we'll
adjourn a bit early.

2502
01:45:50,926 --> 01:45:52,166
I'll stick around with Peter

2503
01:45:52,166 --> 01:45:54,436
for any one-on-one questions
you might have but otherwise,

2504
01:45:54,436 --> 01:45:56,006
we will see you again
on Wednesday

2505
01:45:56,006 --> 01:45:58,906
and after Wednesday's lecture,
we'll flow right into section

2506
01:45:58,906 --> 01:46:00,556
and office hours of
you have questions

2507
01:46:00,556 --> 01:46:03,136
about content even though the
first project won't be released

2508
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:03,876
for a week or so.

2509
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:04,616
All right.

2510
01:46:04,616 --> 01:46:05,476
See you in a couple of days.

2511
01:46:06,516 --> 01:46:18,660
